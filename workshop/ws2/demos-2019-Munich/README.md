# Scenarios

The following scenarios demonstrate the interoperability of devices across different manufactuers.

## Home integration scenarios

Scenario: Automatically turn off devices when user leaves the room  

### Description:
An environment sensor is capable of identifying when a room is empty by measuring the oxygen level.
When the "room empty" condition is detected.
the room is cleaned by a vacuum cleaner,  lights are turned off, window blinds are closed and a surveillence camera is turned on.

### Device interactions

environment sensor - cloud service  
...

## Industrial integration scenarios

Scenario: Automatically alert and protect citizens when a chemical plant has an accident

### Description
An environment sensor is capable of measuring air quality by measuring the oxygen level.
When a low oxygen condition is detected by the Oracle IoT-Cloud Service Asset Monitoring application,
connected devices take the appropriate action to protect and alert citizens,
such as draining a tank in the factory, turning off all air-conditioners, flash alert and warning lights,
pubish alert messages and make voice announcements.

### Device interactions

## Energy management in a smart building/smart city


## Additional Scenarios: 

### Enterprise integration scenarios
Ex: Access control and security system

### Transportation scenarios
Ex: Fleet management
Ex: Shipping and inventory control (supply chain management)

### TDs:
Please place all TDs into the TDs directory. 

### Tools:
Please place all tools into the tools directory. 


### Cloud:
* Oracle IoT Cloud Service Instance  
  Like in the previous plug fests there is an instance of the Oracle IoT Cloud Service available for interoperability tests.  
  It is shared among all plug fest participants, so please coordinate with Michael.Lagally@oracle.com if you have questions.  
  The management console is available at:
  \<t.b.d.\>  

  The instance is using the same password, as previously communicated to individual companies. Please let Michael.Lagally@oracle.com know if you require access.
  
* Oracle Digital Twin Simulator  
  There is an instance of the Oracle Digital Twin Simulator for plug fest participants. It hosts several simulations, such as a HVAC, Pump, Truck, Connected Car. Instances of simulated devices can be provided for plug fest participants on request.  
  Please let Michael.Lagally@oracle.com know if you require a simulated device instance.  
  The login page is at: \<t.b.d.\>
  

### Google Hangout:
   - Used to video stream remote devices such as Festo Live or Panasonic Lab
   - \<t.b.d.\>
