# Web of Things (WoT) Policy

## Minutes

This policy applies to each WoT main call or WoT TF call,

- An Etherpad link is created for each meeting or a set of meetings (e.g., one Etherpad for two TD Calls in a week)
- At the end of the meeting, the scribe clicks on the star button to create a snapshot for that day.
- The TF lead creates a PR in the https://github.com/w3c/wot repository right after the meeting (or set of meetings).
- The file path of minutes is `minutes/TASKFORCE/YYYYMMDD/Readme.md`
- The minutes are saved as a Markdown file for easy rendering on GitHub.
- The attendees, scribe, and what the attendees have said must be recorded (not word-for-word
as in a transcript, but paraphrased sufficiently to carry each speaker's meaning).
- The minutes are written in Markdown format even though they are written in Etherpad. The template below is to be used.
