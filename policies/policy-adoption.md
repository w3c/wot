# Web of Things (WoT) Policy
## Policy Adoption
- Ideally, a new issue should be created to motivate a new or change a Policy
- A new policy proposal should be discussed in the main call if there is a need of consensus. 
- To propose the details of a new policy, create a PR against [wot/policies](https://github.com/w3c/wot/tree/main/policies). 
    - Comments taken on the PR can be used for gathering feedback during "development"
    - The policy should be updated as appropriate to take feedback into account
- After at least two weeks from when the PR is first posted, a Call for Resolution can be made in the main call about whether or not to adopt the proposed policy.
   - If there is consensus in the Resolution, the PR may be merged.
   - If there is not consensus, but changes are requested to allow consensus, the PR may remain open and a later call for resolution held.
   - If consensus cannot be reached, the PR should be closed without merging.
- Rejected policies (for which no consensus can be reached in a group resolution or for which the group resolution is to reject the policy proposal) should be closed without merging but not deleted.
