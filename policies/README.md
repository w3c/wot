# Policies
Active Web of Things WG policies adopted by group resolution.

To propose a new policy, prepare a draft first in [wot/proposals/policies](https://github.com/w3c/wot/tree/main/proposals/policies) and then
call for a group resolution to adopt it.  If the group resolution passes, it can be moved here and added to the index below.
