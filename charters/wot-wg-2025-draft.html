      <p class="mission">The <strong>mission</strong> of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/wot">Web of Things Working
          Group</a> is to counter the fragmentation of the Internet of
          Things (IoT) through the specification of building blocks that
          enable easy integration of IoT devices and services across IoT
          platforms and application domains. 
          <!-- the link to the group is ALWAYS that available from https://www.w3.org/groups/wg or https://www.w3.org/groups/ig because each group page can then point to a different homepage, but not the other way around. -->
          These building blocks complement and enhance the use of
          existing standards; provide a common description across
          different ecosystems, standards, and communities; and provide
          prescriptive definitions where appropriate.

        <h2>Motivation and Background</h2>
      <p>Currently the IoT is highly fragmented with a multitude of
      different standards and ecosystems which often do not easily
      interoperate. This is a concern as much of the value of the
      IoT can only be obtained when devices and services from
      different vendors can be used together. The standards
      developed by Web of Things (WoT) are intended to address this
      issue by defining additional building blocks to allow systems
      from different "ecosystems" to interoperate. The WoT WG will
      focus on IoT standards for commercial and industrial
      deployments and ecosystems. As part of its work the WoT WG
      will aim to build strong liaisons with related
      organizations.</p>

      <p>As a continuation of the work in <a href=
      "https://www.w3.org/2023/10/wot-wg-2023.html">the previous
      charter</a>, this working group is tasked with the
      standardization or extension of the building blocks to
      address the use cases and requirements <!--identified by <a href=
      "https://www.w3.org/groups/ig/wot">the Web of Things Interest
      Group</a> (IG)--> to advance the Web of Things. The WoT building
      blocks complement and integrate existing and emerging IoT
      standards using Web technologies. As a result, the building
      blocks enable cross-platform and cross-domain
      interoperability in the IoT.

        <h2>Scope</h2>
      <!-- What exactly is in scope, and out of scope.
          For legal review. Be brief. -->
      <p>During this charter, the Working Group would work on the
      following:</p>
      <dl>
        <dt><strong>Support New Use Cases</strong>:</dt>
        <dd>Address the requirements of new use cases, such as
        Digital Twins and integration with edge and cloud
        systems.</dd>
        <dt><strong>Update and Refactor Existing
        Specifications</strong>:</dt>
        <dd>The WG will add new features, address issues discovered
        during implementation of the current set of specifications,
        and reorganize material between documents as appropriate.
        These are not be limited to backward-compatible updates,
        however great care will be taken to minimize the impact on
        existing implementations.</dd>
        <dt><strong>Support WoT Interoperability</strong>:</dt>
        <dd>The WG will improve out-of-the-box interoperability and
        enable the integration of WoT into other ecosystems and
        communities. Thus, the WG will define core binding and
        profiling mechanisms, and define additional profiles and
        bindings, as appropriate.</dd>
        <dt><strong>Improve Management of TDs</strong>:</dt>
        <dd>Additional mechanisms around for the management of TDs
        are needed to improve workflows that use them. Thus, the WG
        will update the Discovery specification with additional
        features, including geolocation.</dd>
        <dt><strong>Increase Descriptiveness of TDs</strong>:</dt>
        <dd>The WG will work on increasing the descriptive power of
        TDs to allow using them in additional use cases. This
        includes describing dynamic resources, historical values
        (timeseries), better describing payloads, both static and
        dynamic geolocation information, manageable actions and
        more precise definitions of data schemas for each type of
        operation.</dd>
        <dt><strong>Improve Security and Privacy</strong>:</dt>
        <dd>Define modular security vocabularies, simplify the use
        of security schemes, and other work as appropriate.</dd>
      </dl>

        <section id="section-out-of-scope">
          <h3 id="out-of-scope">Out of Scope</h3>
      <p>The following features are out of scope, and will not be
      addressed by this Working group.</p>
      <dl class="out-of-scope">
        <dt><strong>Application- and domain-specific metadata
        vocabularies:</strong></dt>
        <dd>The Working Group is restricted to work on cross-domain
        vocabularies.</dd>
        <dt><strong>APIs and security frameworks specific to
        particular platforms external to the W3C:</strong></dt>
        <dd>The scope of the Working Group is restricted to APIs
        and security frameworks that are applicable across
        platforms. We will not define new security mechanisms but
        will use existing mechanisms and best practices.</dd>
        <dt><strong>Modification of protocols:</strong></dt>
        <dd>If during work on bindings, it becomes apparent that
        changes are needed to protocols, the Web of Things Working
        Group will rely on the organization responsible for the
        protocol to make the changes. It is out of scope for the
        Working Group to standardize such changes itself.</dd>

	  <h2>Success Criteria</h2>

    <!-- Testing and interop -->
	  <p>In order to advance beyond
		  <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#RecsCR" title="Candidate Recommendation">Candidate Recommendation</a>, each normative specification is expected to have
		  <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#implementation-experience">at least two independent interoperable
			  implementations</a> of every feature defined in the specification, where
interoperability can be verified by passing open test suites. In order to advance beyond Candidate Recommendation, each normative specification must have an open test suite of every feature defined in the specification.</p>
	  <p>There should be testing plans for each specification, starting from the earliest drafts.</p>
    <p>To promote interoperability, all changes made to specifications
      in Candidate Recommendation
      or to features that have deployed implementations
      should have <a href='https://www.w3.org/2019/02/testing-policy.html'>tests</a>.
      Testing efforts should be conducted via the <a href="https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt">Web Platform Tests</a> project.</p>

    <!-- Horizontal review -->

    <p>Each specification should contain separate sections detailing all known security and
      privacy implications for implementers, Web authors, and end users.</p>

	  <p>Each specification should contain a section on accessibility that describes the benefits and impacts, including ways specification features can be used to address them, and
		recommendations for maximising accessibility in implementations.</p>

    <!-- W3C Statements and Web Platform Design Principles -->
    <p>This group is expected to be guided by the following documents:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ethical-web-principles/">Ethical Web Principles</a>,</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/privacy-principles/">Privacy Principles</a>,</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/design-principles/">Web Platform Design Principles</a>.</li>
    </ul>

	</section>

      <section id="coordination">
        <h2>Coordination</h2>
        <p>For all specifications, this Working Group will seek <a href="https://www.w3.org/guide/documentreview/#how-to-get-horizontal-review">horizontal review</a> for
          accessibility, internationalization, privacy, and security with the relevant Working and
          Interest Groups, and with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/other/tag/" title="Technical Architecture Group">TAG</a>.
          Invitation for review must be issued during each major standards-track document transition, including
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#RecsWD" title="First Public Working Draft">FPWD</a>.  The
          Working Group is encouraged to engage collaboratively with the horizontal review groups throughout development of
          each specification.  The Working Group is advised to seek a review at least 3 months before first entering
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#RecsCR" title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</a> and is encouraged
          to proactively notify the horizontal review groups when major changes occur in a specification following a review.</p>

        <p>Additional technical coordination with the following Groups will be made, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#WGCharter">W3C Process Document</a>:</p>

      	<p class="todo">In addition to the above catch-all reference to horizontal review which includes accessibility review, please check with chairs and staff contacts of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/apa/">Accessible Platform Architectures Working Group</a> to determine if an additional liaison statement with more specific information about concrete review issues is needed in the list below.</p>

Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed in public repositories and may permit direct public contribution requests.
        The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings) will be available from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/wot">Web of Things Working Group home page.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            Most Web of Things Working Group teleconferences will focus on discussion of particular specifications, and will be conducted on an as-needed basis.
        </p>
        <p>
            This group primarily conducts its technical work  on the public mailing list <a id="public-name" href="mailto:public-wot-wg@w3.org">public-wot-wg@w3.org</a> (<a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-wot-wg/">archive</a>)
          or on <a id="public-github" href="https://github.com/w3c/wot/issues">GitHub issues</a>.
          The public is invited to review, discuss and contribute to this work.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases when a participant requests such a discussion.

        <h2>
          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#Consensus">W3C Process Document (section 5.2.1, Consensus)</a>. Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
        <p>
           However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.

          A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email, GitHub issue or web-based survey), with a response period from t to 10 working days</span>, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.

          If no objections are raised by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs.
        </p>
        <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 5.2.3, Deciding by Vote)</a> and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.
