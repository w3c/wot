      <p class="mission">
        The <strong>mission</strong> of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/ig/wot">Web of Things Interest Group</a> is to counter the fragmentation of the 
        Internet of Things by complementing available standards through Web technology capable of
        interconnecting existing Internet of Things platforms, devices, gateways, and cloud services.
        We aim to reduce costs through the global reach of Web standards, to enable open markets of services, and to unleash the power of the network effect.
        As a W3C Interest Group, we are seeking to build a deeper understanding of the Web of Things by investigating consumer, industrial, environmental, 
        energy management, and smart city scenarios.
        This is intended to identify demand for further standards-track work within W3C working groups and to better align with the established W3C liaisons.

        <h2>Motivation and Background</h2>
        <p>
          The Internet of Things (IoT) suffers from a lack of interoperability across platforms.
          As a result developers are faced with data silos, high integration and maintenance costs, and limited market potential.
          Existing IoT standards address only limited ecosystems and do not provide interoperability across domains.
          The current IoT is like the Internet before the World Wide Web, with competing incompatible hypertext systems.
          The W3C is applying lessons learned from the World Wide Web to the Internet of Things to create the Web of Things.
        </p>
        <p>
          To achieve this goal for cross-platform and cross-domain interoperability,
          the <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/wot">Web of Things Working Group</a> has developed a first set of standardized building blocks.
          The core idea is based upon rich metadata that describes the data and possible interactions (i.e., affordances) exposed to applications,
          and the communications and security requirements for platforms to communicate effectively.
          The central documents are the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-architecture/">WoT Architecture</a> and 
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-thing-description/">WoT Thing Description</a> with its <i>Properties, Actions, Events</i> interaction model.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/ig/wot">Web of Things Interest Group</a> continues its work to support the WoT Working Group 
          and to explore opportunities for new standards-track work within W3C.
          The priority in this third charter period is gaining additional practical experience with the in-development building blocks in the field
          to enable open markets of services on the scale of the Web.
          To achieve this goal, the Interest Group is seeking to broaden the range of participants to provide the necessary skills
          and resources for real-world application scenarios in different verticals.

          The Web of Things Interest Group (WoT IG) is a forum for discussion of ideas relating to the Web of Things
          and is intended to complement the role of the Web of Things Working Group (WoT WG).
          In particular, the WoT IG will propose new work items based upon new requirements, use cases,
          and discussions with IoT developer communities, 
          standards development organizations,
          industry alliances,
          and vertical industry solution and infrastructure providers.
          Conversely, the WoT IG will consider new topics that are submitted to it by the WoT WG.
        </p>

        <h3 id="plugfest">PlugFest and Testing</h3>
        <p>
          An important activity is the operation of PlugFests to collect interoperability implementation experience 
          and to validate the current working assumptions of the potential building blocks discussed in the Web of Things Interest Group.
          These events enable developers to get together to test their implementations and facilitates networking between partners and experts.
          The Interest Group will seek to encourage work on open source projects and community evaluation of the Web of Things.
          In more detail, PlugFests allow participants to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>assist with preparing implementation reports for WoT WG Candidate Recommendations</li>
          <li>test-drive upcoming or proposed technologies for the W3C Recommendation Track</li>
          <li>identify and test-drive upcoming or proposed technologies as they apply to the collection of technologies required to address specific industry and user community needs</li>
          <li>take part in interoperability experiments across implementations for ideas at different levels of maturity</li>
          <li>reach out to other communities and new members through an OpenDay for non-members, which usually includes a demo track</li>
          <li>ensure interoperability between WoT technologies and assistive technologies used by people with disabilities</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="usecases">Use Cases and Requirements</h3>
        <p>
          The Interest Group will identify requirements for standardization in two ways: first, by exploring use cases and requirements for concrete consumer, industrial, 
          environmental, energy management, and smart cities application scenarios, and second, through examining the requirements for integrating a broad range of IoT platforms into the Web of Things.
          The exploration tasks that the Interest Group will undertake may include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>use cases and requirements for different application scenarios and user communities</li>
          <li>lifecycle management of Things</li>
          <li>security requirements and supporting technologies, such as key management and access controls</li>
          <li>clarify relationship with the concept of Digital Twins</li>
          <li>out-of-the-box device onboarding to cloud services</li>
          <li>WoT Scripting API and possible simplifications</li>
          <li>hypermedia-driven interactions for complex/multi-step Actions and Events</li>
          <li>community-driven, bottom-up vocabulary to enable semantic interoperability</li>
          <li>Concrete protocol bindings (e.g. for HTTP, WebSockets, CoAP)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Further ideas for topics are expected from discussions and expert presentations of IoT projects,
          including for example,
          Graph Data,
          Edge Computing,
          Machine Learning,
          and Sustainability.
          The Interest Group will incubate work items for the Web of Things until they are ready for transfer to the W3C Recommendation Track, 
          either in existing Working Groups, such as the WoT WG, or in new Working Groups.

interoperability can be verified by passing open test suites, and two or
more implementations interoperating with each other. In order to advance to
Proposed Recommendation, each normative specification must have an open
test suite of every feature defined in the specification.</p>
	  <p>There should be testing plans for each specification, starting from the earliest drafts.</p>
    <p><span class='todo'>Consider adopting a healthy testing policy, such as:</span> 
      To promote interoperability, all changes made to specifications 
      in Candidate Recommendation 
      or to features that have deployed implementations
      should have <a href='https://www.w3.org/2019/02/testing-policy.html'>tests</a>.  
      Testing efforts should be conducted via the <a href="https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt">Web Platform Tests</a> project.</p>

    <p>Each specification should contain sections detailing all known security and
      privacy implications for implementers, Web authors, and end users.</p>

	  <p><i class="todo">For specifications of technologies that directly impact user experience, such as content technologies, as well as protocols and APIs which impact content: </i>
		Each specification should contain a section on accessibility that describes the benefits and impacts, including ways specification features can be used to address them, and
		recommendations for maximising accessibility in implementations.</p>

    <p>This <i class="todo">(Working|Interest)</i> Group expects to follow the
    TAG <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/design-principles/">Web Platform Design Principles</a>.

        <h2>Coordination</h2>
        <p>For all deliverables, 
           this Interest Group will seek <a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/Charter.html#horizontal-review">horizontal review</a> 
           for accessibility, internationalization, performance, privacy, and security with the relevant Working and Interest Groups, 
           and with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/" title="Technical Architecture Group">TAG</a>. 
           Invitation for review must be issued during each major standards-track document transition, 
           including <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsWD" title="First Public Working Draft">FPWD</a> .
           The Interest Group is encouraged to engage collaboratively with the horizontal review groups throughout development of
            each document.  The Interest Group is also encouraged
           to proactively notify the horizontal review groups when major changes occur in its technical reports following a review.
        </p>

        <p>Additional technical coordination with the following Groups will be made,

          Participation
        </h2>
        <p>
          To be successful, 
          this Interest Group is expected to have 6 or more active participants for its duration, 
          including representatives from the key implementors of this specification, 
          and active Editors and Test Leads for each specification. 
          The Chairs, specification Editors, 
          and Test Leads are expected to contribute half of a working day 
          per week towards the Interest Group. 
          There is no minimum requirement for other Participants.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public mailing lists and document repositories, as described in <a href='#communication'>Communication</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical submissions for consideration upon their agreement to the terms of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/">W3C Patent Policy</a>.
        </p>
        <p>Participants in the group are required (by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#ParticipationCriteria">W3C Process</a>) to follow the
          W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/">Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct</a>.</p>

          the meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review,
          and technical discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that
          can be both read and written to by the general public.
          Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed in public repositories 
          and may permit direct public contribution requests.
          The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however.

        <h2>
          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, 
          per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus">W3C Process Document (section 5.2.1, Consensus)</a>. 
          Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, 
          which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, 
          and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
        <p>
          However, 
          if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after careful consideration 
          of the range of views presented, 
          the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, 
		any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.
          A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email and/or web-based survey), with a response period from one week to 10 working days, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.
          If no objections are raised on the mailing list by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Interest Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
        </p>
        <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 5.2.3, Deciding by Vote)</a> and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.

        <h2>Patent Disclosures </h2>
        <p>The Interest Group provides an opportunity to
          share perspectives on the topic addressed by this charter. W3C reminds
          Interest Group participants of their obligation to comply with patent
          disclosure obligations as set out in <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/#sec-Disclosure">Section
            6</a> of the W3C Patent Policy. While the Interest Group does not
          produce Recommendation-track documents, when Interest Group
          participants review Recommendation-track specifications from Working
