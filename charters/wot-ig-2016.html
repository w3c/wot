      <p class="mission">The <strong>mission</strong> of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WoT/IG/">Web of Things Interest Group</a> is to counter the fragmentation of the Internet of Things by introducing a Web-based abstraction layer capable to interact existing Internet of Things platforms and complementing available standards. We aim to reduce costs through the global reach of Web standards, to enable open markets of services, and to unleash the power of the network effect. As a W3C Interest Group, we are seeking to build a shared understanding of the Web of Things, and to identify opportunities for initiating standards track work within W3C working groups. Liaisons between W3C, industry alliances and standards development organizations are already discussed for two critical areas: semantic interoperability and end-to-end security across different platforms.</p>

<section id="intro" class="scope">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
		
    <p>The Internet of Things (IoT) suffers from a lack of interoperability across platforms. As a result developers are faced with data silos, high costs, and limited market potential. This can be likened to the situation before the Internet, when there were competing non-interoperable networking technologies. The Internet makes it easy to develop networked applications independently of those technologies. The W3C is seeking to do the same for the Internet of Things with the Web of Things.</p>
	
    <p>To achieve this goal for cross-platform interoperability, we need platform-independent APIs for application developers and a means for different platforms to discover how to inter-operate with one another. The approach we are taking is based upon rich metadata that describes the data and interaction models exposed to applications, and the communications and security requirements for platforms to communicate effectively. A further aspect is the need to enable platforms to share the same meaning when they exchange data. We are therefore seeking to enable expression of the semantics of things and the domain constraints associated with them, building upon W3C's extensive work on RDF and Linked Data. This is the second charter for the Web of Things Interest Group and continues the work on identifying requirements for the technology building blocks for the application layer that forms the Web of Things.</p>
    
    <p>The Web of Things is founded on the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-webarch-20041215/">Architecture of the World Wide Web</a>. Things stand for physical or abstract entities such as sensor nodes and services encompassing multiple devices, respectively. Each thing is identified with a URI. This URI can be followed to access the thing's description, which can include its relationship to other things, analogous to links in HTML. The Web of Things also allows for on-device data processing and direct thing-to-thing interaction. For this, things can provide a standardized vendor neutral runtime environment for portable apps, similar to Web apps running in every browser. Due to the variations in requirements across application domains, there are many protocols. Things can be interacted with on many kinds of platforms and devices ranging from resource-constrained IoT devices and less constrained gateways to cloud-based server farms. In addition, Web browsers may be used for the human-machine interface for services based around the Web of Things.</p>
    
    <p>The short term priority for the Interest Group is to launch a Working Group to initiate standardization of work items that the Interest Group believes are ready for progression along the W3C Recommendation track. In the mid-term, the priority is to demonstrate how the Web of Things can be used across a wide range of IoT platforms in collaboration with the corresponding consortia and organizations. This will include work on metadata for describing particular platforms, as well as work on semantic models and constraints, and enabling end-to-end security across different platforms. In the long term, the priority will be on enabling open markets of services on the scale of the Web.</p>

    <h2>Scope</h2>

    <p>
      <a href="wot-ig-2016-relationship.png"><img id="relationships" src="wot-ig-2016-relationship.png" alt="relationship between WoT IG and WG" /></a>
      The Web of Things Interest Group (WoT IG) is a forum for discussion of ideas relating to the Web of Things and is intended to complement the role of the proposed Web of Things Working Group. In particular, the Interest Group will propose new Work Items for the Working Group based upon new use case considerations and discussions with IoT developer communities, industry alliances, and standards development organizations. Vice versa, the Interest Group will consider new topics that are submitted to it by the Working Group.
    </p>
    
    <p>The Interest Group will identify requirements for standardization in two ways: first, by exploring use cases and requirements for a broad range of application domains, and second, through examining the requirements for integrating a broad range of IoT platforms into the Web of Things. Two areas that have already been identified as critical are semantic interoperability and end-to-end security across different platforms. The Interest Group will work on these in coordination with external groups to address their needs.</p>
    
    <p>In the mid term, this is expected to include an exploration of the role of semantic technologies for representing and applying domain constraints, and an exploration of the role of trust assumptions for enabling end-to-end security across platforms using standards defined by different organizations. This work would combine implementation experience with in-depth analysis. The Interest Group is seeking to broaden the range of participants to provide the necessary skills and resources to conduct this work.</p>

    <p>An important activity is the operation of PlugFests to test interoperability and to validate the current working assumptions of the technological building blocks discussed in the Web of Things Interest Group as well as proposed Working Group. These events enable developers to get together to test their implementations and facilitates networking between partners and experts. The Interest Group will seek to encourage work on open source projects and community evaluation of the Web of Things. In more detail, PlugFests allow participants to:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>assist with preparing implementation reports for WoT WG Candidate Recommendations</li>
      <li>test-drive upcoming or proposed technologies for the W3C Recommendation Track</li>
      <li>take part in interoperability experiments across implementations for ideas at different levels of maturity</li>
      <li>reach out to other communities and new Members through an OpenDay for non-Members, which usually includes a demo track</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>In the long term, the Interest Group will use the practical experience gained from these experiments as a basis for identifying new work items. Further ideas for topic areas are expected from discussions and expert presentations of IoT projects, including for example, decentralised IoT systems and the role of blockchains. Another example is the exploration of ideas for a vendor neutral Web platform for apps that are installed on home gateways. The Interest Group will incubate work items for the Web of Things until they are ready for transfer to the W3C Recommendation Track, either in existing Working Groups, such as the Web of Things Working Group, or in new working groups.</p>

	<h3>Long-term Deliverables</h3>

	<p>These deliverables cover critical areas for the Interest Group's mission. Note that to help with these, we are seeking new participants with expertise in the areas of embedded systems, IoT platforms and protocols, security, data types, and semantic modelling. In particular, we expect deliverables that report on in-depth practical studies on:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Enabling end-to-end security across a hetergeneous set of platforms</li>
		<li>The role of semantic models and domain constraints as a basis for interoperability, which will include work on the role of APIs for providing developers with a more convenient way to work with semantic models</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Additional deliverables may be added by the Interest Group as appropriate to explore specific topics in greater depth.</p>

<section class="participation">
    <h2 id="participation">Participation</h2>
    
    <p>To be successful, this interest group is expected to have 6 or more active participants for its duration, including representatives from the key implementors of this specification and active Editors and Test Leads for each specification. The Chairs, specification Editors, and Test Leads are expected to contribute half of a day per week towards the Interest Group. There is no minimum requirement for other Participants.</p>
        
    <p>The group encourages questions, comments, and issues on its public mailing lists and document repositories as described in <a href='#communication'>Communication</a>.</p>

</section>

<section id="communication">
    <h2>Communication</h2>
    
    <p id="public">Technical discussions for this Interest Group are conducted in <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>. Meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and technical discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public. Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed on a public repository and may permit direct public contribution requests.</p>

    <p>Information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings) will be available from the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WoT/WG/">Web of Things Interest Group home page.</a></p>
    
    <p>Most Web of Things Interest Group teleconferences will focus on discussion of particular specifications and will be conducted on an as-needed basis.</p>
    
    <p>This group primarily conducts its technical work on the public mailing list <a id="public-name" href="mailto:public-wot-ig@w3.org">public-wot-ig@w3.org</a> (<a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-wot-ig/">archive</a>). The public is invited to post messages to this list.</p>
    
    <p>The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and Members of the group, for Member-only discussions in special cases when a participant requests such a discussion. </p>
</section>

<section id="decisions">
    <h2>Decision Policy</h2>
    
    <p>This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#Consensus"> W3C Process Document (section 3.3</a>). Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with Members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
    
    <p>However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress, but consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote, and record a decision along with any objections.</p>
    
    <p>To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional. A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email and/or web-based survey), with a response period from one week to 10 working days, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.

    <h2 id="patentpolicy">Patent Disclosures</h2>

    <p>The Web of Things Interest Group provides an opportunity to share perspectives on the topic addressed by this charter. W3C reminds Interest Group participants of their obligation to comply with patent disclosure obligations as set out in <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/#sec-Disclosure">Section 6</a> of the W3C Patent Policy. While the Interest Group does not produce Recommendation-track documents, when Interest Group participants review Recommendation-track specifications from Working Groups, the patent disclosure obligations do apply.</p>

    <p>For more information about disclosure obligations for this group, please see the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2004/01/pp-impl/">W3C Patent Policy Implementation</a>.</p>
