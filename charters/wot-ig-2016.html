	<h2>Introduction</h2>
		
	<p>The Internet of Things (IoT) suffers from a lack of interoperability across platforms. As a result developers are faced with data silos, high costs and limited market potential. This can be likened to the situation before the Internet when there were competing non-interoperable networking technologies. The Internet makes it easy to develop networked applications independently of those technologies. W3C is seeking to do the same for the Internet of Things.</p>
	
    <p>To achieve this goal, we need platform independent APIs for application developers, and a means for different platforms to discover how to inter-operate with one another. The approach we are taking is based upon rich metadata that describes the data and interaction models exposed to applications, and the communications and security requirements for platforms to communicate effectively. A further aspect is the need to enable platforms to share the same meaning when they exchange data. We are therefore seeking to enable expression of the semantics of things and the domain constraints associated with them, building upon W3C's extensive work on RDF and Linked Data.</p>
    
    <p>The Web of Things is founded on the core architecture of the Web. Things stand for physical or abstract entities. Each thing is identified with a URI. This URI can be dereferenced to access the thing's description, which can include its relationship to other things. Due to the variations in requirements across application domains, there are many protocols. Things can be interacted with on many kinds of platforms and devices including resource constrained IoT devices, gateways and cloud-based server farms. In addition, Web browsers may be used for the human-machine interface for services based around the Web of Things.</p>
	
    <h2>Scope</h2>

	<div class="summary">
	<p style="text-align:center;font-style:italic">Scope Summary</p>
	<p>The Web of Things Interest Group seeks to:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Support the proposed Web of Things Working Group</li>
		<li>Explore areas and identify work that is ready for transfer to the W3C Recommendation Track</li>
		<li>Organize and run plugfests to evaluate the current working assumptions of Web of Things technology building blocks</li>
		<li>Reach out and collaborate with interested parties, vendors and communities in support of the  Interest Group's mission</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	
	<p>The Web of Things Interest Group is a forum for discussion of ideas relating to the Web of Things and is intended to complement the role of the proposed Web of Things Working Group. This is illustrated in the following diagram.</p>

<section id="coordination">

    <h2>Coordination</h2>

    <p>For all specifications, this Interest Group will seek <a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/Charter.html#horizontal-review">horizontal review</a> for accessibility, internationalization, performance, privacy, and security with the relevant Working and Interest Groups, and with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/" title="Technical Architecture Group">TAG</a>. Invitation for review must be issued during each major standards-track document transition, including <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#RecsWD" title="First Public Working Draft">FPWD</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#RecsCR" title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</a>, and should be issued when major changes occur in a specification.</p>
    
    <p class="issue"><b>Issue:</b> The paragraph above replaces line-item liaisons and dependencies with individual horizontal groups. There's been a suggestion to name and individually link the specific horizontal groups inline, instead of pointing to a page that lists them.</p>
    
    <p class="issue"><b>Issue:</b> The requirement for an invitation to review before FPWD and CR may seem a bit overly restrictive, but it only requires an invitation, not a review, a commitment to review, or even a response from the horizontal group. This compromise offers early notification without introducing a bottleneck.</p>

    <p>Additional technical coordination with the following Groups will be made, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#WGCharter">W3C Process Document</a>:</p>

    </div>
</section>

<section class="participation">

    <h2 id="participation">Participation</h2>
    
    <p>To be successful, this Interest Group is expected to have 6 or more active participants for its duration, including representatives from the key implementors of this specification, and active Editors and Test Leads for each specification. The Chairs, specification Editors, and Test Leads are expected to contribute half of a day per week towards the Interest Group. There is no minimum requirement for other Participants.</p>
        
    <p>The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public mailing lists and document repositories, as described in <a href='#communication'>Communication</a>.</p>
        
    <p>The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical submissions for consideration, with the agreement from each participant to Royalty-Free licensing of those submissions under the W3C Patent Policy.</p>
</section>

<section id="communication">
    <h2>Communication</h2>
    
    <p id="public">Technical discussions for this Interest Group are conducted in <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>. Meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and technical discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public. Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed on a public repository, and may permit direct public contribution requests.</p>

    <p>Information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings) will be available from the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WoT/WG/">Web of Things Interest Group home page.</a></p>
    
    <p>Most Web of Things Interest Group teleconferences will focus on discussion of particular specifications, and will be conducted on an as-needed basis.</p>
    
    <p>This group primarily conducts its technical work on the public mailing list <a id="public-name" href="mailto:public-wot-ig@w3.org">public-wot-ig@w3.org</a> (<a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-wot-ig/">archive</a>). The public is invited to post messages to this list.</p>
    
    <p>The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases when a participant requests such a discussion. </p>
</section>

<section id="decisions">
    <h2>Decision Policy</h2>
    
    <p>This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/policies#Consensus"> W3C Process Document (section 3.3</a>). Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
    
    <p>However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress, but consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote, and record a decision along with any objections.</p>
    
    <p>To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional. A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email and/or web-based survey), with a response period from one week to 10 working days, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue. If no objections are raised on the mailing list by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Interest Group.</p>
    
    <p>All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available, or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.</p>
    
    <p>This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/policies#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 3.4, Votes)</a>, and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.</p>
