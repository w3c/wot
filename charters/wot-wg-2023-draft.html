	The <strong>mission</strong> of the
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/wot">Web of Things Working Group</a>
        is to counter the fragmentation of the IoT through
        the specification of building blocks
        that enable easy integration of IoT devices and services
        across IoT platforms and application domains.
        These building blocks should complement and enhance existing standards.
        This
        <a class="todo" href="">Working Group Charter</a>
        covers those aspects that the

           <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/ig/wot">Web of Things Interest Group</a> (IG)
           as being important to advancing the Web of Things.
           The WoT building blocks are intended to complement existing
           and emerging IoT standards by focusing on enabling cross-platform and cross-domain interoperability.
           The proposed work items are summarized in the <a href="#scope">Scope</a> section, and
	   include <span class="todo">(REVISE) interoperability profiles for particular usage contexts;
           vocabulary support for new protocols, security schemes, and links;
           standardized discovery mechanisms;
	   and improvements to Thing Description Templates.</span>
           These work items will be prototyped and tested by multiple implementors in
           WoT IG <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wot/current-practices/wot-practices.html#plugfests">PlugFests</a>

        <p>
          To be successful, this <i class="todo">(Working|Interest)</i> Group is expected to have 6 or more active participants for its duration, including representatives from the key implementors of this specification, and active Editors and Test Leads for each specification. The Chairs, specification Editors, and Test Leads are expected to contribute half of a working day per week towards the <i class="todo">(Working|Interest)</i> Group. There is no minimum requirement for other Participants.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public mailing lists and document repositories, as described in <a href="https://w3c.github.io/charter-drafts/charter-template.html#communication">Communication</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical submissions for consideration upon their agreement to the terms of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/">W3C Patent Policy</a>.
        </p>
        <p>Participants in the group are required (by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#ParticipationCriteria">W3C Process</a>) to follow the
          W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/">Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct</a>.</p>

          Technical discussions for this <i class="todo">(Working|Interest)</i> Group are conducted in <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>: the meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and technical discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public. Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed in public repositories and may permit direct public contribution requests.
        The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings) will be available from the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/charter-drafts/charter-template.html"><i class="todo">[name]</i> (Working|Interest) Group home page.</a>

          The public is invited to review, discuss and contribute to this work.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases when a participant requests such a discussion.

        <h2>
          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus">W3C Process Document (section 5.2.1, Consensus)</a>. Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
        <p>
           However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.

          A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email, GitHub issue or web-based survey), with a response period from <span id="cfc"><i class="todo">[pick a duration within:] one week to 10 working days</i></span>, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.

          If no objections are raised by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the <i class="todo">(Working|Interest)</i> Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
        </p>
        <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 5.2.3, Deciding by Vote)</a> and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.

          Patent Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This Working Group operates under the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/">W3C Patent Policy</a> (Version of 15 September 2020). To promote the widest adoption of Web standards, W3C seeks to issue Web specifications that can be implemented, according to this policy, on a Royalty-Free basis.

          For more information about disclosure obligations for this group, please see the <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/[shortname]/ipr">licensing information</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>Patent Disclosures </h2>
        <p>The Interest Group provides an opportunity to
          share perspectives on the topic addressed by this charter. W3C reminds
          Interest Group participants of their obligation to comply with patent
          disclosure obligations as set out in <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/#sec-Disclosure">Section
            6</a> of the W3C Patent Policy. While the Interest Group does not
          produce Recommendation-track documents, when Interest Group
          participants review Recommendation-track specifications from Working
          Groups, the patent disclosure obligations do apply. For more information about disclosure obligations for this group,
