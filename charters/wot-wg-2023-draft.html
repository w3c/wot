	The <strong>mission</strong> of the
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/wot">Web of Things Working Group</a>
        is to counter the fragmentation of the IoT through
        the specification of building blocks
        that enable easy integration of IoT devices and services
        across IoT platforms and application domains.
        These building blocks should complement and enhance existing standards.
        This
        <a class="todo" href="">Working Group Charter</a>

           <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/ig/wot">Web of Things Interest Group</a> (IG)
           as being important to advancing the Web of Things.
           The WoT building blocks are intended to complement existing
           and emerging IoT standards by focusing on enabling cross-platform and cross-domain interoperability.
           The proposed work items are summarized in the <a href="#scope">Scope</a> section, and
	   include <span class="todo">(REVISE) interoperability profiles for particular usage contexts;

	        </dl>
	      </div>

	<p>Details for each of these are given below.</p>

	<h3 id="discovery-updates-workitem">Discovery Updates</h3>
        <p>
        Various updates are expected to be needed to align the Discovery spec with updates to other
        proposed deliverables in this charter, for example updates to the information model,
	including support for all versions of the Thing Description specification,
        and to improve security and validation.
        </p>

	<h3 id="discovery-thing-models-workitem">Discovery of Thing Models</h3>
        <p>
        Currently only Thing Descriptions can be stored in TD Directories, but it would be useful
        to also store Thing Models in them, in particular to allow links to Thing Models to be 
        resolved by reference to a TD  Directory.
        </p>

	<h3 id="discovery-coap-dir-workitem">Discovery CoAP Directory</h3>
        <p>
        Currently, TD Directory services only have an HTTP API defined.
        TD Directories are the only Discovery exploration mechanism supporting the 
        return of multiple Thing Descriptions, and they may also be needed in the 
        case of constrained devices hosting multiple Things.
        However, the cost of using HTTP in constrained environments can be prohibitive.  
        Defining a CoAP API with equivalent
        functionality to the HTTP API would allow the API to be used and provided by constrained devices,
        including those that simply want to self-host multiple TDs.
        </p>

	<h3 id="discovery-jsonpath-query-language-workitem">Discovery JSON Path Query Language</h3>
        <p>
        Currently there is no mandatory query language support for TD Directories.
        This means that consumers will often need to download the contents of the entire
        directory if the id of a target TD is not known.
        An endpoint for SPARQL queries is defined but because of the difficulty of supporting RDF processing 
        it is optional.  
        JSON Path is still currently under discussion as an IETF RFC but was not mature enough to include 
        during the last charter. 
        JSON Path queries would complement the current SPARQL-based query support but would be lighter-weight 
        to implement and use.
        </p>

	<h3 id="discovery-query-filters-workitem">Discovery Query Filters</h3>
        <p>
        Some simple query filters would be added to the API for specific
        common use cases, such as filtering by type, time, or keyword.
        These filters would be chainable with each other and with query language results,
        so that, for example, the result of a JSON Path query might them be filtered by time without
        needing to complicate the JSON Path query with time computations.
        This mechanism would also be able to support <a href="#geolocation-workitem">filtering by geolocation</a>.
        </p>

	<h3 id="geolocation-workitem">Geolocation</h3>
        <p>
        Many WoT use cases have identified a need to limit discovery by geographic location or
        to identify the location of a Thing. 
        To support this, a standard way to encode geolocation metadata is needed 
        (or several ways, each identified using a profile) and (for discovery) query mechanisms 
        that can filter by this metadata. 
        Geolocation metadata should be aligned with existing standards, 
        and should support both static and dynamic situations.
        Geolocation information may be included in either TDs or in data
        delivered directly from the Thing and ideally
        both situations would be supported.
        Since multiple standards and use cases exist for geolocation information, profiles
        to constrain how it should be encoded in particular situations (for example, in Building 
        Information Management Systems) would be useful.
        </p>

	<h3 id="onboarding-workitem">Onboarding</h3>
        <p>
        In order to establish secure communications in some contexts,
        for example on a LAN,
        some form of onboarding process to establish mutual trust between Things and Consumers is needed.
        Having a prescriptive (but optional) process for this would be useful.

        Onboarding may be part of a larger "lifecycle" which would be described in the 
        Architecture document.

        In this work item we will define mechanisms to perform secure minimum-effort onboarding of Things 
        that conforms to the security and privacy requirements of specific 
        deployment scenarios and use cases.

        This work item complements the work that is done for device discovery, 
        and is in particular useful when registering TDs with a TD Directory service,
        however is also applicable for other use cases.
        </p>

	<h3 id="sec-ontology-workitem">Security Scheme Ontology</h3>
        <p>
        Currently security schemes are "baked into" the TD specification but 
        it would be more manageable and consistent to break them out 
        as separate ontologies so that all security schemes would be done via extensions. 
        Then the TD 2.0 spec would only have to include general-purpose "structural" security schemes 
        like <code>nosec</code> and <code>combo</code>. 
        The security ontologies and URLs for them would be published in a new Registry Track Note.
        </p>

	<h3 id="signing-workitem">Signing</h3>
        <p>
        A mechanism for signing JSON-LD documents was under discussion in the last charter 
        but was not mature enough to include. 
        Adding support for RDF canonicalization and signing in alignment with those standards would 
        be helpful to ensure that TDs are not intercepted and modified by third parties. 
        This may also require a definition of TD canonicalization.        
        Verifying a signature requires identity management, i.e. the verifier needs to 
        know or have trusted access to the public key of the signer.
        Directories should be extended to verify signatures and generate new chained signatures
        as needed.
        </p>

	  <h2>Success Criteria</h2>

    <!-- Testing and interop -->
	  <p>In order to advance to 
		  <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsPR" title="Proposed Recommendation">Proposed Recommendation</a>, each normative specification is expected to have 
		  <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#implementation-experience">at least two independent interoperable
			  implementations</a> of every feature defined in the specification, where
interoperability can be verified by passing open test suites, and two or
more implementations interoperating with each other. In order to advance to
Proposed Recommendation, each normative specification must have an open
test suite of every feature defined in the specification.</p>
	  <p>A testing plan will be developed for each specification, starting from the earliest drafts.</p>
    <p>To promote interoperability, all changes made to specifications 
      in Candidate Recommendation 
      or to features that have deployed implementations
      should have <a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/02/testing-policy.html">tests</a>.  

    <!-- Horizontal review -->
    <p>Each specification should contain sections detailing all known security and privacy implications for implementers, Web authors, and end users.</p>
<!--
	  <p><i class="todo">For specifications of technologies that directly impact user experience, such as content technologies, as well as protocols and APIs which impact content: </i>
		Each specification should contain a section on accessibility that describes the benefits and impacts, including ways specification features can be used to address them, and
		recommendations for maximising accessibility in implementations.</p>
-->
	
	</section>

      <section id="coordination">
        <h2>Coordination</h2>
        <p>For all specifications, this Working Group will seek <a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/documentreview/#how_to_get_horizontal_review">horizontal review</a> for
          accessibility, internationalization, privacy, and security with the relevant Working and
          Interest Groups, and with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/" title="Technical Architecture Group">TAG</a>.
          Invitation for review must be issued during each major standards-track document transition, including
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsWD" title="First Public Working Draft">FPWD</a>.  The
          Working Group is encouraged to engage collaboratively with the horizontal review groups throughout development of
          each specification.  The Working Group is advised to seek a review at least 3 months before first entering
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsCR" title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</a> and is encouraged
          to proactively notify the horizontal review groups when major changes occur in a specification following a review.</p>

        <p>Additional technical coordination with the following Groups will be made, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#WGCharter">W3C Process Document</a>:</p>

      	<p class="todo">In addition to the above catch-all reference to horizontal review which includes accessibility review, please check with chairs and staff contacts of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/APA/">Accessible Platform Architectures Working Group</a> to determine if an additional liaison statement with more specific information about concrete review issues is needed in the list below.</p>

          Participation
        </h2>
        <p>
          To be successful, this Working Group is expected to have 6 or more active participants for its duration, including representatives from the key implementors of this specification, and active Editors and Test Leads for each specification. The Chairs, specification Editors, and Test Leads are expected to contribute half of a working day per week towards the Working Group. There is no minimum requirement for other Participants.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public mailing lists and document repositories, as described in <a href="https://w3c.github.io/charter-drafts/charter-template.html#communication">Communication</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical submissions for consideration upon their agreement to the terms of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/">W3C Patent Policy</a>.
        </p>
        <p>Participants in the group are required (by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#ParticipationCriteria">W3C Process</a>) to follow the
          W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/">Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct</a>.</p>

          Communication
        </h2>
        <p id="public">
          Technical discussions for this Working Group are conducted in <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>: the meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and technical discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public. Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed in public repositories and may permit direct public contribution requests.
        The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings) will be available from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WoT/">Web of Things (WoT) Working Group home page.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Most Web of Things (WoT) Working Group teleconferences will focus on discussion of particular specifications, and will be conducted on an as-needed basis.  However, one teleconference will be held weekly to coordinate activities among the task forces responsible for each specification.
        </p>
        <p>
          This group primarily conducts its technical work  
          on <a id="public-github" href="https://github.com/w3c/wot">GitHub issues</a>, using 
          a main repository for general topics and more specific repositories for individual specifications.
          The public is invited to review, discuss and contribute to this work.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases when a participant requests such a discussion.

          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus">W3C Process Document (section 5.2.1, Consensus)</a>. Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
        <p>
           However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.

          A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email, GitHub issue or web-based survey), with a response period from one week to 10 working days, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.

          If no objections are raised by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
        </p>
        <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 5.2.3, Deciding by Vote)</a> and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.
