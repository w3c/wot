        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>This working group is tasked with the standardization of four technological building blocks 
           identified by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WoT/IG/">Web of Things Interest Group</a> (IG) 
           as being key to realizing the Web of Things. 
           These building blocks will complement existing 
           and emerging standards by focusing on enabling cross-platform and cross-domain interoperability, 
           as opposed to creating yet another IoT standard. 
           The initial concepts are detailed in the 
           <a href="http://w3c.github.io/wot/current-practices/wot-practices.html">WoT Current Practices document</a> 
           of the IG and summarized in the <a href="#scope">Scope</a> section. 
           There has already been successful incubation of these building blocks in 
           multiple IG <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wot/current-practices/wot-practices.html#plugfests">PlugFests</a>, 
           where several companies and research institutes have presented and tested their WoT prototypes. 
           Initial open-source implementations are also already available.</p>

      </section>

      <section id="scope" class="scope" style="clear:both;">
        <h2>Scope</h2>
        
        <p>The Working Group has four items in scope to enable interoperability across IoT platforms:</p>
        
        <div class="summary">
          <p style="text-align:left;font-style:italic">Scope Summary</p>
          
          <dl>
            <dt><strong>Thing Description:</strong></dt>
            <dd>Semantic vocabularies for describing the data and interaction models exposed to applications, 
                the choice of communications patterns provided by protocols, 
                and serialization formats suitable for processing on resource-constrained devices and 
                transmission over constrained networks.</dd>
            <dt><strong>Scripting API:</strong></dt>
            <dd>Platform-independent application-facing API for Thing-to-Thing interaction 
                and Thing lifecycle management.</dd>
            <dt><strong>Binding Templates:</strong></dt><dt>
            </dt><dd>Example mappings from the abstract messages to specific common platforms and protocols in collaboration with the 
                corresponding organizations.</dd>
            <dt><strong>Security and Privacy:</strong></dt><dt>
            </dt><dd>Cross-cutting policies and mechanisms integrated into the other building blocks to describe and implement security and 
                privacy policies to enable secure and safe interaction across different IoT platforms.</dd>
          </dl>
        </div>
          <p>Of these, the first deliverable, the normative Thing Description standard, is central, 
            with the other items playing supporting roles.
            The Scripting API is also normative but simply serves to provide a standardized and convenient way to access 
            the functionality of the Thing Description from a programming language in order to build concrete applications.  
            Binding Templates are informational and provide mappings to concrete protocols.  
            This deliverable also provides templates for describing further protocol mappings through
            the Thing Description.
            The Security and Privacy deliverable is normative, 
            but while considered separately, its implementation is integrated into the other deliverables.
          </p>
          <p>
            Details for each of these are given below.
          </p>

        <h3>Thing Description</h3>

        <p>The Working Group will develop solutions to describe Things through metadata and declarations of their capabilities 
           (e.g., possible interactions). 
           This work includes the definition of different <i>machine-understandable vocabulary sets</i>
           as well as serialization formats of such a Thing Description. 
           The Thing Description will be aimed at enabling scalable and automated tooling, including but not limited to search, 
           automated bridging, service composition, validation, and development abstractions.
           While enabling the use of powerful tooling, the Thing Description will be designed in such a way
           that even constrained devices can use it.
           In particular, for basic usages there will not be an explicit dependence on RDF and
           it will not be necessary for constrained systems to perform explicit semantic processing.
           However, to enable more complex usages, the Thing Description will include extension points 
           to allow the use of semantic vocabularies and tools 
           (e.g., Linked Open Data, Schema.org, Resource Description Framework (RDF), semantic reasoners, etc.).
        </p>
        <p>The Thing Description will include the following components:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A common vocabulary for describing Things in terms of the data and interaction models they 
            expose to and/or consume from applications 
            (e.g., interaction patterns such as Properties, Actions, and Events as described in the 
            <a href="http://w3c.github.io/wot/current-practices/wot-practices.html">WoT Interest Group current practices document</a>). 
            This vocabulary will cover Thing lifecycles, 
            datatypes (including streams and integrity constraints), 
            and provision for early and late binding. 
            This cross-domain vocabulary will be designed for use in combination with vocabularies for 
            domain-specific semantics and metadata. 
          </li>

          <li>A common vocabulary for security and privacy metadata as a basis for platforms to determine how to 
            securely interoperate. 
            This will build upon emerging standards and best practices for securing exchanges, 
            including metadata relating to authentication, authorization, secure communication, and privacy policies.
            <!--
            The use of such metadata will be optional (to support deployments that prefer to inform the requester 
            via error responses rather than upfront). 
-->
            It will support, but not mandate, 
            the utilization of online trusted third party services such as authorization servers. 
            It will support a variety of security token form factors of established serialization formats, 
            domain-specific security token contents (e.g., building automation), and various security models. 
            It will support a variety of protocols for their acquisition and for transportation. 
            Support for secure communications will consider transport as well as application-level security.</li>

          <li>A common vocabulary for communications metadata. 
            This will enable platforms to determine how to interoperate given a choice of protocols, 
            data formats, and encodings, as well as different communication patterns, 
            e.g., push, pull, pub-sub, and peer-to-peer. 
            Communications metadata may be needed to describe the multiplexing of data from different sensors, 
            different approaches to buffering data, 
            and the interoperability requirements for communicating with battery-powered or ambient-powered devices 
            that spend a lot of their time asleep to conserve power.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p> Serialization formats for the Thing Description suitable for use by resource-constrained platforms
            will be provided
            and designed to appeal to application developers. 
            The encoding shall allow for resource-efficient instantiation of the software objects that 
            reflect the data and interaction models of Things. 
            Where practical, 
            this will be based upon existing formats and encodings (e.g., EXI- or CBOR-compressed JSON-LD).
        </p>

        <h3>Scripting API</h3>

        <p>The Working Group will seek to specify an API exposed to applications covering the following:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Interactions with Things and reactions/handlers to provide the functionality of a Thing. 
            This includes APIs both for applications acting in the client role interacting with a Thing as well as 
            APIs for applications in the server role, exposing a Thing.</li>

          <li>Discovery for local and remote cases, 
            abstracting away from the details of the discovery mechanisms. 
            This will cover a range of approaches: 
            Things on the same host, 
            Things nearby, 
            Things on the same network, 
            Things listed in a repository, 
            and discovery based upon formal or crowd-sourced semantics and social relationships.
            The API will support a Thing lifecycle including registering and creating Things, either
            from a Thing Description or using scripting.   The API will make applications aware of
            lifecycle transitions.
          </li>

          <li>Cross-platform security frameworks including authentication, 
            authorization, 
            and secure communication, 
            as well as the means for their establishment through provisioning of metadata and keying associations. 
            This will enable the use of security frameworks, 
            such as IETF OAuth and ACE, according to the specific tasks for the client 
            (e.g., security credentials acquisition and supply), 
            and for the server (e.g., security token enforcement and validation), 
            as well as common tasks (e.g., registration). 
            A goal is to decouple applications from the implementations of the security frameworks. 
            This introduces online trusted-third party components to which constrained WoT components 
            delegate specific processing tasks (such as authentication and authorization). 
            It requires trusted assertions that report about such processing events as well 
            as protocols to trigger such processing.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Where practical, APIs will be defined in ways that are independent of the choice of programming languages. 
          The scope includes APIs for User Agents/browsers as well as APIs for faceless applications in a runtime 
          environment such as Node.js. 
          The underlying assumptions and contracts between the runtime environment and the application 
          (e.g., security policies and callback signatures) will be well-defined.</p>
        <p>It should be emphasized that this is a secondary deliverable and in case of conflicts, 
          the Thing Description deliverable will have priority.</p>


        <h3>Binding Templates</h3>

        <p>While the Thing Description will provide general mechanisms to describe arbitrary protocols,
          to enable interoperability, 
          the Working Group will define standard binding templates for common protocols.
          These standard binding templates will be created in close collaboration with the industry alliances 
          and standards development organizations responsible for these. 
          This includes definition of mappings from the interactions at the Thing Layer to:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Transfer layer communication patterns such as push, pull, pub-sub, bi-directional messaging, etc.</li>
          <li>Specific protocols at the transfer layer, 
            e.g., 
            REST-based protocols such as HTTP and CoAP, 
            pub-sub protocols such as MQTT, 
            and raw channel-based protocols such as WebSockets</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The Web of Things has a multi-protocol architecture and bindings to both IP and non-IP transports 
          (e.g., Bluetooth Low Energy) may be defined.</p>
        
        <p>Support for secure communications will be included, as defined by the Security and Privacy deliverable.</p>
        
        <p>The Binding Templates deliverable is informative by nature since the intended capabilities 
          of the Thing Description could be used to describe any protocol, even common ones, from first principles.
          However, interoperability will be enhanced by providing and encouraging the use of 
          standard binding templates for common protocols when possible.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Security and Privacy</h3>

        <p>The mechanisms for security and privacy must be cross-cutting over the descriptions, scripting APIs, and bindings. 
         The Thing Description and the Scripting API will support both transport and object security using best practices,
          and the Binding Templates will support the use of appropriate security for the protocols they map to.
        </p>
        <p>In order to enhance the security of WoT systems, we will also generate and implement a security testing
          plan which will include both functional and adversarial testing of the proposed standards and their implementations.  
          We will only recommend an implementation of the proposed standards for use in production once it has 
          passed such testing.
        </p>

        <p>To be successful, this Working Group is expected to have 6 or
 more active participants for its duration, including representatives 
from the key implementors of this specification, and active Editors and 
Test Leads for each specification. The Chairs, specification Editors, 
and Test Leads are expected to contribute half of a day per week towards
 the Working Group. There is no minimum requirement for other 
Participants.</p>
        
        <p>The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public mailing lists and document repositories, as described in <a href="#communication">Communication</a>.</p>
        
        <p>The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical 
submissions for consideration, with the agreement from each participant 
to Royalty-Free licensing of those submissions under the W3C Patent 
Policy.</p>

          Communication
        </h2>
        <p id="public">
          Technical discussions for this Working Group are conducted in <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>.
 Meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be 
archived for public review, and technical discussions and issue tracking
 will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by 
the general public. Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications
 will be developed on a public repository, and may permit direct public 
contribution requests.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information about the group (including details about 
deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings) will 
be available from the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WoT/WG/">Web of Things Working Group home page.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Most Web of Things Working Group teleconferences will focus on
 discussion of particular specifications, and will be conducted on an 
as-needed basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          This group primarily conducts its technical work on the public mailing list <a id="public-name" href="mailto:public-wot-wg@w3.org">public-wot-wg@w3.org</a> (<a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-wot-wg/">archive</a>). The public is invited to post messages to this list.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for 
administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and members
 of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases when a 
participant requests such a discussion.

      <section id="decisions">
        <h2>
          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#Consensus"> W3C Process Document (section 3.3</a>).
 Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, 
which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other 
reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being 
required.</p>
        <p>
           However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress, but 
consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of 
views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote, and record a 
decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational 
deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a
 face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.

          A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions 
(for example, via email and/or Web-based survey), with a response period
 from one week to 10 working days, depending on the chair's evaluation 
of the group consensus on the issue.

          If no objections are raised on the mailing list by the end of 
the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus
 as a resolution of the Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved 
unless and until new information becomes available, or unless reopened 
at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
        </p>
        <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/policies#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 3.4, Votes)</a>, and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.
