        <h3>TD Security Schemes</h3>
	<p>
          In the context of a 
          <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wot-thing-description">WoT Thing Description (TD)</a>, 
          a security scheme defines vocabulary for 
          describing public security metadata indicating the 
          security mechanisms and requirements for accessing a Thing.
          Currently the TD specification includes standard vocabulary 
          for several security schemes in common use by IoT devices.
          However, security mechanisms are constantly evolving and to stay relevant
          WoT TDs need to support new security schemes on an ongoing basis.
          The TD specification does include a vocabulary extension mechanism which can
          be used to support new security schemes.  
          However, to maximize interoperability,
          these extension vocabularies should be standardized and where appropriate,
          included by default by the core TD context.
        </p>
        <p>
          Based on a list of target security mechanisms identified by
          the WoT Interest Group, this work item will include the following tasks:
          <ol>
          <li>For each target security mechanism, define a standard extension
              vocabulary for a security scheme supporting that mechanism
              that can be used with the current TD specification.</li>
          <li>For a core set of security schemes, propose extensions to the 
              core TD vocabulary to include them by default.</li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
          Candidates for target security schemes include support 
          for all flows in OAuth2, support for PoP Tokens, and support for ACE.
        </p>
	      
	<h3>TD Link Relation Types</h3>
	<p>
          The
          <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wot-thing-description">WoT Thing Description (TD)</a>
          includes a link mechanism to declare (potentially bidirectional) relationships between
          the TD and other entities identified by URIs, including but not limited to other TDs.
          Each link includes a relation type which specifies the purpose of the link.
          Link relation types must use an IANA name.
          However, to maximize interoperability, 
          relation types for specific purposes should be identified.
          In collaboration with the WoT Interest Group and after use-case
          analysis, the Working Group will identify IANA relation types of
          particular interest and specify their use for suitable use cases.
          If a suitable IANA relation type does not exist for an identified
          use case the Working Group may seek to establish a new link type,
          but this will be done only if absolutely necessary.
        </p>
	<p>
          Candidates for link relation type specification include part-of and subtype-of 
          relationships to support Templates and Components, respectively.
          Other link types may be used to identify location or controller-controlled 
          relationships.
        </p>
	      
	<h3>Architecture Use Cases and Vocabulary</h3>
        <p>
          The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-architecture">WoT Architecture</a>
          specification includes the definitions of several terms and concepts used to
          define WoT specifications.  These are often related closely to use cases
          and architectural patterns.  As WoT implementations mature, it will be 
          necessary to define new use case, architectural patterns, and associated 
          concepts and vocabulary.  In addition, descriptions of existing use cases
          architectural patterns may need to be clarified or refactored to include
          these new concepts.
        </p>
	<p>
          Candidates for architectural vocabulary extension include a Producer concept 
          and definition of information lifecycle and code deployment models.
          The information lifecycle is especially relevant to the protection
          of privacy.
        </p>

	<h3>TD Vocabulary</h3>
	<p>
          The
          <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wot-thing-description">WoT Thing Description (TD)</a>
          context includes a core set of vocabulary.
          This vocabulary can be extended by including additional context files.
          However, to support new use cases and protocols in a consistent (interoperable) way,
          especially in cases where JSON-LD processing is not possible,
          extensions to this core vocabulary may be necessary.
	</p>
	<p>
          Candidates for TD vocabulary extension include 
          support for Data Schemas consistent with current versions of JSON Schema, 
          extensions to Data Schemas to support XML and CBOR 
          (and possibly other structured payload data formats), 
          support for additional standard metadata such as location or device manufacturer,
          and better support for default values.
        </p>

        <h3>Protocol Vocabulary</h3>
	<p>
          The
          <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wot-thing-description">WoT Thing Description (TD)</a>
          specification is augmented by a 
          <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wot-protocol-binding">WoT Protocol Binding</a>
          document which defines templates for how to use a TD to describe Things
          using specific concrete protocols.
          However, individual concrete protocols may require additional vocabulary
          to define header options and other metadata.
          These are defined using vocabulary extensions specific to each protocol.
          Currently only a limited set of protocols are supported in a standard way.  
          This work item will add support for an additional set of target protocols, 
          where appropriate in collaboration with the defining standards body.
        </p>
        <p>
          Candidates for extended protocol vocabulary include support 
          for CoAP(S), CoAP(S)+WS(S), MQTT, and OPC-UA.
        </p>

        <h3>Smart Home Profile</h3>
        <p>Support for Plug-and-Play interoperability in the Smart Home context.
        TD default values without override, and 
        finite limits on allowable URI schemes, media types, etc.
        </p>

        <h3>Implementation View Specification</h3>
        <p>“Web Thing API”-like.
        Fully specify details such as error responses, common features, etc.
        Could be represented relative to specific profiles.
        </p>

        <h3>Complex Interactions</h3>
        <p>Document the ability to monitor and cancel ongoing actions.
        Support action/event queues and error recovery via hypermedia responses.
        </p>

        <h3>Observe Defaults</h3>
        <p>Specify exact defaults for observe, including methods and subprotocols,
        for important protocols including HTTP.
        </p>

        <h3>Identity Managementy</h3>
        <p>Privacy-preserving architecture.  
        Identity management lifecycle.
        Commissioning, onboarding, identifier updates and notifications, offboarding, and decommissioning.</p>

        <h3>Discovery</h3>
        <p>Privacy-preserving architecture.
        Introductions, directory services, and peer-to-peer discovery.</p>

        <h3>TD Templates</h3>
        <p>Instances vs. classes. Subtype and component relationships.</p>

	for accessibility, internationalization, performance, privacy, and security with the relevant Working and Interest Groups,
	and with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/" title="Technical Architecture Group">TAG</a>. 
	Invitation for review must be issued during each major standards-track document transition,

        <p>
          To be successful, this Working Group is expected to have 6 or more active participants for its duration, including representatives from the key implementors of this specification, and active Editors and Test Leads for each specification. The Chairs, specification Editors, and Test Leads are expected to contribute half of a working day per week towards the Working Group. There is no minimum requirement for other Participants.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public mailing lists and document repositories, as described in <a href='#communication'>Communication</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical submissions for consideration upon their agreement to the terms of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/">W3C Patent Policy</a>.
        </p>
        <p>Participants in the group are required (by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#ParticipationCriteria">W3C Process</a>) to follow the
          W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/">Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct</a>.</p>

        <p id="public">
          Technical discussions for this Working Group are conducted in <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>: the meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and technical discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public. Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed on a public repository and may permit direct public contribution requests.
        The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings) will be available from the <a href="">Working Group home page.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Most Working Group teleconferences will focus on discussion of particular specifications, and will be conducted on an as-needed basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          This group primarily conducts its technical work 
          on GitHub issues using both
          a <a class="todo" id="public-github" href="https://github.com/wot">master repo</a> and
          repos specific to each deliverable.
          The public is invited to review, discuss and contribute to this work.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases when a participant requests such a discussion.

      <section id="decisions">
        <h2>
          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process,
          per the 
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus"> W3C Process Document (Section 3.3)</a>. 
          Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, 
          which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, 
          and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
        <p>
          However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus 
          is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, 
          the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, 
          any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting 
          or teleconference will be considered provisional.

          A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions 
          (for example, via email and/or web-based survey), 
          with a response period from one week to 10 working days, 
          depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.

          If no objections are raised on the mailing list by the end of the response period, 
          the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless 
          and until new information becomes available or 
          unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
        </p>
        <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with the 
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 3.4, Votes)</a> 
          and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.
