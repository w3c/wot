        the specification of building blocks 
        that enable easy integration of IoT devices and services
        across IoT platforms and application domains.
        These building blocks should complement and enhance existing standards.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This working group is tasked with the standardization 
           or extension of several technological building blocks 
           identified by the 
           <a href="https://www.w3.org/WoT/IG/">Web of Things Interest Group</a> (IG) 
           as being important to advancing the Web of Things. 
           The WoT building blocks are intended to complement existing 
           and emerging IoT standards by focusing on enabling cross-platform and cross-domain interoperability. 
           The proposed work items are summarized in the <a href="#scope">Scope</a> section, and
           include profiles for particular usage contexts;
           vocabulary support for new protocols, security schemes, and links;
           standardized discovery mechanisms;
           and improvements to Thing Description Templates.
           These work items will be prototyped and tested by multiple implementors in
           WoT IG <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wot/current-practices/wot-practices.html#plugfests">PlugFests</a> 
           during development.

        <p>Details for each of these are given below.</p>

	<h3>Architectural Requirements, Use Cases, and Vocabulary</h3>
        <p>
          The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-architecture">WoT Architecture</a>
          specification includes the definitions of several terms and concepts used to
          define WoT specifications.  These are often related closely to use cases
          and architectural patterns.  As WoT implementations mature, it will be 
          necessary to understand and state the requirements for new use cases, 
          architectural patterns, and associated 
          concepts and vocabulary.  
          In addition, descriptions of existing use cases
          architectural patterns may need to be clarified or refactored to include
          these new concepts.
        </p>
	<p>
          Candidates for architectural vocabulary extension include a 
          TD Producer concept 
          and definition of device and information lifecycles.
          The information lifecycle is especially relevant to the protection
          of privacy.
        </p>

	<h3>Link Relation Types</h3>
	<p>
          The
          <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wot-thing-description">WoT Thing Description (TD)</a>
          includes a link mechanism to declare (potentially bidirectional) relationships between
          the TD and other entities identified by URIs, including but not limited to other TDs.
          Each link includes a relation type which specifies the purpose of the link.
          Link relation types must use an IANA name.
          However, to maximize interoperability, 
          relation types for specific purposes should be identified.
          In collaboration with the WoT Interest Group and after use-case
          analysis, the Working Group will identify IANA relation types of
          particular interest and specify their use for suitable use cases.
          If a suitable IANA relation type does not exist for an identified
          use case the Working Group may seek to establish a new link type,
          but this will be done only if absolutely necessary.
        </p>
	<p>
          Candidates for link relation type specification include part-of and subtype-of 
          relationships to support Components and Templates, respectively.
          Other link types may be used to identify location or controller-controlled 
          relationships.
        </p>

        <h3>Interoperability Profiles</h3>
        <p>The
          <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wot-thing-description">WoT Thing Description (TD)</a>
          provides a general framework for describing the interface to a Thing
          independent of the network protocol, data encoding, or security mechanism used.  
          TDs are defined to be extensible since IoT protocols, data encodings, and security mechanisms 
          are constantly evolving.
          However, this openness works against interoperability since it is 
          not clear in advance what technologies must be supported by a given
          implementation of a TD Consumer, and a TD Consumer can only work with
          Things supporting the technologies it includes an implementation for.
        </p>
        <p>
          In many contexts, "plug and play" interoperability is
          desirable. 
          For example, in the Smart Home context,
          the consumer needs to know in advance of purchase whether
          a set of devices will work with each other. 
          Such predictability is also an asset in many other contexts, 
          including industrial use cases.
          Unfortunately the set of technologies that must be supported depend on 
          context: protocols, data types, and security mechanisms 
          essential in an industrial context 
          (for example, OPC-UA and XML) may be an
          unnecessary burden for a home gateway to have to implement.
        </p>
        <p>
          To resolve this problem this work item will define "profiles" which
          define subsets of TDs that support only the features
          suitable for a given context.  
          This work item will include the following:
          <ol>
            <li>
               Definition of a mechanism to identify the profile 
               or profiles that a given TD is conformant to.
            </li>
            <li>
               Definition of what features in a TD may be limited by a profile.
            </li>
            <li>
               Definition of profiles for specific application domains
               and use cases.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>

        <h3>Templates</h3>
        <p>Current
          <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wot-thing-description">WoT Thing Descriptions</a>
          apply to specific Things, for example, particular devices.
          However, there are often many devices manufactured with the same
          interface and capabilities.  These devices differ from each other 
          only in certain specific aspects, 
          such as being installed in different locations
          and having different identifiers.
        </p>
        <p>
          The current TD specification includes the definition of a "TD Template"
          which is a partial TD that omits information that is specific to an instance.
          However, the current definition of TD Templates 
          only allows definition of the interaction model without a protocol binding.  
          During software development however, if we wish to
          design code to talk to a class of devices, 
          we may need to have some knowledge of the protocol binding as well.  
        </p>
        <p>
          A closely related problem is that of components: 
          we may wish to assemble a Thing Description from a set
          of reusable, modular capabilities.  
          How is a TD Component to be defined and how are they to be combined
          into a complete Thing?  How is a Consumer able to determine that a
          particular Thing supports a specific sub-interface common to a set
          of Things?
        </p>
        <p>
          This work item will elaborate and refine the TD Template concept so
          it can satisfy such extended use cases.
        </p>

        <h3>Complex Interactions</h3>
        <p>
          Many use cases require the implementation of complex
          interactions that span multiple protocol transactions.
          An example would be the instigation, monitoring, 
          and optional cancellation of ongoing actions.
          Another would be managing filtered subscriptions for events.
        </p>
        <p>
          In fact such complex interactions can be implemented 
          with the more basic features already included in the 
          <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wot-thing-description">WoT Thing Description</a>
          and in particular can be supported in a self-describing
          way with hypermedia controls.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, there are many possible ways to support such 
          complex interactions.  To better support the goals of
          interoperability, it would be useful to document
          how to implement the most common complex interactions. 
        </p>
        <p>
          This work item will document the implementation of complex
          interactions, including:
          <ol>
          <li>The ability to monitor and cancel ongoing actions.</li>
          <li>Support for action/event queues.</li>
          <li>Error recovery via hypermedia responses.</li>
          </ol>
        </p>

        <h3>Discovery</h3>
        <p>During the previous charter a format for the storage of
          the metadata required to access a Thing was defined: the
          <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wot-thing-description">WoT Thing Description (TD)</a>.
          However, no mechanism was defined for the distribution of TDs.
          To preserve privacy, TDs should only
          be distributed to parties with a permission to access the data.
          However, we also wish to support flexible discovery of the services
          and devices described by WoT TDs.
          Discovery should be available at both local and global scales.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this work item we will specify a privacy-preserving architecture
          for Thing discovery.  
          To approach this problem we can distinguish 
          between an "introduction", which is a first-contact protocol, and 
          "exploration", which retrieves detailed information about services.
          Introductions should only provide the address
          of an "exploration" service.
          An exploration service, in turn, would provide detailed metadata
          about services but only after authentication.
          Introduction and exploration could take several forms.
          Introductions can be any mechanism that returns an address
          of an exploration service.  In the local context broadcast
          protocols, DHCP, DNS-SD, Bluetooth beacons, QR codes, 
          and a variety of other mechanisms could be used.  In the global
          context a search engine could be used.  However, in all cases
          introductions would result in the address of an exploration service. 
          Exploration could be implemented as a web service
          providing a searchable directory of TDs.  
          However, by making the 
          addresses returned by introductions opaque and requiring authentication
          for access to exploration services we can control who has access
          to detailed information about specific devices.
          Peer-to-peer discovery could be supported as a special
          case of this where Things self-host their own introductions
          and exploration services.
        </p>
        <p>
          This work item will require a coordinated effort with other standards
          bodies such as IETF also working on discovery so that a common architecture
          can be defined.  
          The architecture proposed by the Working Group
          needs to support both peer-to-peer discovery and 
          directory-based discovery, both local and global discovery,
          and be privacy-preserving.
        </p>

        <h3>Identity Management</h3>
        <p>
          A <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wot-thing-description">WoT Thing Description</a>
          contains an identifier meant to be
          unique to every Thing. This identifier is essential for database
          management (for example, for device inventory) but also 
          constitutes a privacy risk.  In particular, an immutable
          unique identifier might be used to track a device and from 
          that infer the location or activities of the owner of that device.
          If identifiers persist across transfer of ownership of 
          devices, they might also be used to trace commercial transactions.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to preserve privacy, such identifiers may need to
          be considered mutable so that such tracking can be disrupted.
          More generally, the lifecycle of such identifiers needs to 
          be defined: when they are assigned, when and how they are
          updated, how notifications of such updates can be issued to
          authorized parties, and how the identities must be deleted
          when an object is decommissioned or replaced when a device
          changes ownership.
        </p>
        <p>
          This work item would define an identity management lifecycle
          that would seek, as much as possible, to mitigate the privacy
          risks posed by explicit device identifiers while retaining
          their functionality in database management and indexing.
        </p>

        <h3>Security Schemes</h3>
	<p>
          In the context of a 
          <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wot-thing-description">WoT Thing Description (TD)</a>, 
          a security scheme defines vocabulary for 
          describing public security metadata indicating the 
          security mechanisms and requirements for accessing a Thing.
          Currently the TD specification includes standard vocabulary 
          for several security schemes in common use by IoT devices.
          However, security mechanisms are constantly evolving and to stay relevant
          WoT TDs need to support new security schemes on an ongoing basis.
          The TD specification does include a vocabulary extension mechanism which can
          be used to support new security schemes.  
          However, to maximize interoperability,
          these extension vocabularies should be standardized and where appropriate,
          included by default by the core TD context.
        </p>
        <p>
          Based on a list of target security mechanisms identified by
          the WoT Interest Group, this work item will include the following tasks:
          <ol>
          <li>For each target security mechanism, define a standard extension
              vocabulary for a security scheme supporting that mechanism
              that can be used with the current TD specification.</li>
          <li>For a core set of security schemes, propose extensions to the 
              core TD vocabulary to include them by default.</li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
          Candidates for target security schemes include support 
          for all flows in OAuth2, support for PoP Tokens, and support for ACE.
        </p>
	      
	<h3>TD Vocabulary</h3>
	<p>
          The
          <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wot-thing-description">WoT Thing Description (TD)</a>
          context includes a core set of vocabulary.
          This vocabulary can be extended by including additional context files.
          However, to support new use cases and protocols in a consistent (interoperable) way,
          especially in cases where JSON-LD processing is not possible,
          extensions to this core vocabulary may be necessary.
	</p>
	<p>
          Candidates for TD vocabulary extension include 
          support for Data Schemas consistent with current versions of JSON Schema, 
          extensions to Data Schemas to support XML and CBOR 
          (and possibly other structured payload data formats), 
          support for additional standard metadata such as location or device manufacturer,
          and better support for default values.
        </p>

        <h3>Protocol Vocabulary</h3>
	<p>
          The
          <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wot-thing-description">WoT Thing Description (TD)</a>
          specification is augmented by a 
          <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wot-protocol-binding">WoT Protocol Binding</a>
          document which defines templates for how to use a TD to describe Things
          using specific concrete protocols.
          However, individual concrete protocols may require additional vocabulary
          to define header options and other metadata.
          These are defined using vocabulary extensions specific to each protocol.
          Currently only a limited set of protocols are supported in a standard way.  
          This work item will add support for an additional set of target protocols, 
          where appropriate in collaboration with the defining standards body.
        </p>
        <p>
          Candidates for extended protocol vocabulary include support 
          for CoAP(S), CoAP(S)+WS(S), MQTT, and OPC-UA.
        </p>

        <h3>Observe Defaults</h3>
        <p>The WoT interaction model includes abstractions for 
          Properties, Events, and Actions.  
          The Properties abstraction includes an "observe" operation,
          which allows a Thing to asynchronously notify a Consumer
          of a change in a property.
          However, in some protocols of interest, most notably HTTP,
          there is more than one way to implement the observe operation.
          The WoT TD allows the specification of a subprotocol to
          indicate the mechanism used, but unfortunately no default
          is specified.
          Because of this Things using HTTP and observe must currently
          explicitly state the mechanism used, every time.
        </p>
        <p>
          This work item would specify exact defaults for implementing observe, 
          including methods and subprotocols, for all important protocols 
          but most especially HTTP.
        </p>

        <h3>Implementation View Specification</h3>
        <p>The
          <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wot-thing-description">WoT Thing Description (TD)</a>
          specification describes a data format but is currently silent on several aspects of
          implementations that produce or consume TDs.
          In order to better support interoperability,
          more guidances on particular details of implementation is needed.
        </p>
        <p>
          This work item would more fully specify implementation details 
          such as error responses, common features, etc.
          These implementation details might be relative to specific profiles.
        </p>

	  <p>Each specification should contain a section detailing all known security and privacy implications for implementers,
	  Web authors, and end users.</p>
	  <p>There should be testing plans for each specification, starting from the earliest drafts.</p>
	  <p>Each specification should contain a section on accessibility that describes the benefits and impacts,
	  including ways specification features can be used to address them, and
	   recommendations for maximising accessibility in implementations.</p>
	  <p>
	  To promote interoperability, 
          all changes made to specifications should have associated
          <a href='https://www.w3.org/2019/02/testing-policy.html'>tests</a>.</p>  
          In addition, all APIs and data formats should have formal definitions, such as data schemas,

          <p>
            To succeed in establishing inter-platform standards,
            W3C needs to coordinate with IoT alliances and standards development organizations.
            The following list provides examples of organizations with which the WoT Working Group 
            has already had significant coordination during the period of the first charter. 
            A <a href="https://www.w3.org/WoT/IG/wiki/How_does_W3C_compare_to_other_organizations">longer list</a> 
            is available on the Interest Group wiki.

          Participation
        </h2>
        <p>
          To be successful, 
          this Working Group is expected to have 6 or more active participants for its duration, 
          including representatives from the key implementors of this specification, 
          and active Editors and Test Leads for each specification. 
          Ideally the Working Group would be balanced across different
          constituencies, with members from
          end-device manufacturers in various verticals,
          gateway/edge device manufacturers,
          and cloud providers.
          The Chairs, specification Editors, and Test Leads are expected to each 
          contribute at least half of a working day per week towards the Working Group. 
          There is no minimum requirement for other Participants.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group encourages questions, 
          comments and issues on its public mailing lists and document repositories, 
          as described in <a href='#communication'>Communication</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical submissions 
          for consideration upon their agreement to the terms of the 
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/">W3C Patent Policy</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Participants in the group are required 
          (by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#ParticipationCriteria">W3C Process</a>) 
          to follow the W3C 
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/">Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct</a>.

          Technical discussions for this Working Group are conducted in 
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>: 
          the meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings 
          will be archived for public review, 
          and technical discussions and issue tracking 
          will be conducted in a manner that can be 
          both read and written to by the general public. 
          Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed 
          on a public repository and may permit direct public contribution requests.
          The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information about the group 
          (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings) 
          will be available from the <a href="">Working Group home page.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Most Working Group teleconferences will focus on discussion of particular specifications, 
          and will be conducted on an as-needed basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          This group primarily conducts its technical work 
          on GitHub issues using both
          a <a class="todo" id="public-github" href="https://github.com/wot">master repo</a> and
          repos specific to each deliverable.
          The public is invited to review, discuss and contribute to this work.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, 
          at the discretion of the Chairs and members of the group, 
          for member-only discussions in special cases when a participant requests such a discussion.

        <h2>
          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process,
          per the 
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus"> W3C Process Document (Section 3.3)</a>. 
          Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, 
          which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, 
          and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
        <p>
          However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus 
          is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, 
          the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, 
          any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting 
          or teleconference will be considered provisional.

          A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions 
          (for example, via email and/or web-based survey), 
          with a response period from one week to 10 working days, 
          depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.

          If no objections are raised on the mailing list by the end of the response period, 
          the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless 
          and until new information becomes available or 
          unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
        </p>
        <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with the 
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 3.4, Votes)</a> 
          and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.
