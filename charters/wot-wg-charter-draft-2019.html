      <p class="mission">The <strong>mission</strong> of the <a href="">
	      Web of Things Working Group</a> is to 
	      counter the fragmentation of the IoT through standard complementing building blocks

	      This Working Group Charter covers those aspects that the 
	      <a href="http://w3c.github.io/wot/charters/wot-ig-2019.html">Web of Things Interest Group</a> 
	      believes are mature enough to progress to W3C Recommendations.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This working group is tasked with the standardization of <s>four technological building blocks 
           identified by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WoT/IG/">Web of Things Interest Group</a> (IG) 
           as being key to realizing the Web of Things. 
           These building blocks will complement existing 
           and emerging standards by focusing on enabling cross-platform and cross-domain interoperability, 
           as opposed to creating yet another IoT standard. 
           The initial concepts are detailed in the 
           <a href="http://w3c.github.io/wot/current-practices/wot-practices.html">WoT Current Practices document</a> 
           of the IG and summarized in the <a href="#scope">Scope</a> section. 
           There has already been successful incubation of these building blocks in 
           multiple IG <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wot/current-practices/wot-practices.html#plugfests">PlugFests</a>, 
           where several companies and research institutes have presented and tested their WoT prototypes.

          To be successful, this <i class="todo">(Working|Interest)</i> Group is expected to have 6 or more active participants for its duration, including representatives from the key implementors of this specification, and active Editors and Test Leads for each specification. The Chairs, specification Editors, and Test Leads are expected to contribute half of a working day per week towards the (Working|Interest) Group. There is no minimum requirement for other Participants.
        </p>

          The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public mailing lists and document repositories, as described in <a href='#communication'>Communication</a>.

        <p>
          The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical submissions for consideration upon their agreement to the terms of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/">W3C Patent Policy</a>.
        </p>
        <p>Participants in the group are required (by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#ParticipationCriteria">W3C Process</a>) to follow the

Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed on a public repository and may permit direct public contribution requests.
        The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however.

        <h2>
          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus"> W3C Process Document (section 3.3</a>). Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
        <p>
           However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.

          A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email and/or web-based survey), with a response period from one week to 10 working days, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.

          If no objections are raised on the mailing list by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the <i class="todo">(Working|Interest)</i> Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
        </p>
        <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 3.4, Votes)</a> and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.

        <h2>
          Patent Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This Working Group operates under the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/">W3C Patent Policy</a> (Version of 5 February 2004 updated 1 August 2017). To promote the widest adoption of Web standards, W3C seeks to issue Recommendations that can be implemented, according to this policy, on a Royalty-Free basis.

          For more information about disclosure obligations for this group, please see the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2004/01/pp-impl/">W3C Patent Policy Implementation</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>Patent Disclosures </h2>
        <p>The Interest Group provides an opportunity to
          share perspectives on the topic addressed by this charter. W3C reminds
          Interest Group participants of their obligation to comply with patent
          disclosure obligations as set out in <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/#sec-Disclosure">Section
            6</a> of the W3C Patent Policy. While the Interest Group does not
          produce Recommendation-track documents, when Interest Group
          participants review Recommendation-track specifications from Working
          Groups, the patent disclosure obligations do apply. For more information about disclosure obligations for this group,
          please see the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2004/01/pp-impl/">W3C
            Patent Policy Implementation</a>.</p>
