# W3C Web of Things Group Charters

As decided in the [WebConf on 27 Apr 2016](https://www.w3.org/2016/04/27-wot-minutes.html), we now use the following process for our charter work:

## Process

* We start with a charter template only containing boilerplate (i.e., no specific content) in https://github.com/w3c/wot/tree/master/charters
* Each envisioned topic must be formulated in an individual draft and must open a [pull-request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) ("PR").
* We discuss the envisioned topic using GitHub comments on the [corresponding PR](https://github.com/w3c/wot/pulls) (the "Files changed" tab also allows to comment on individual lines).
* The original author is responsible to update the open PR with new commits according to the discussion.
* Only when the participants reach consensus (i.e., no more objections in the comments), W3C staff merges the PR into the master branch.
* The current status of the charter document is accessable for everyone over the w3c.github.io page.
* Feedback on the [mailing list](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-wot-ig/) is still possible and welcome. A directly appointed helper or otherwise the W3C staff is responsible to create corresponding comments or pull-requests on GitHub.

## Howto

* [Fork](https://github.com/w3c/wot/edit/master/charters/README.md#fork-destination-box) the `w3c/wot` repository into your own account
* Create a branch in your fork for one particular topic (e.g., a single IG scope item)
* Make your edits and commit
* Push the new branch to your own repository fork
* GitHub will automatically offer to open a pull-request to `w3c/wot` (from your new branch to master)

## Help

* https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/ provides a tutorial on GitHub pull-requests.
* If you have not worked with GitHub in this way before, we will give direct assistance.
