# Analysis of Historical Data Work Item

This document gathers all information related to time series or historical data-related topics.
These include issues, use cases, and discussions in other forms.

## Overall Description of the Topic

Some edge and cloud services can collect property value changes or event emissions for a certain time.
This data, called time series, can be collected by Consumers to display (or use in any other way) the evolution of the affordance data over time.

## Use Cases

To find the related use cases, the [coverage document](https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/blob/main/USE-CASES/coverage.csv) has been used and another pass through the [use cases document](https://w3c.github.io/wot-usecases) has been made.
