# Scope
The WoT Security Task Force is responsible for:

* Review of WoT related specifications for specific security relevant properties.  These include areas related to:
    * Authentication
    * Authorization
    * Encryption
    * Auditing
* Review of use cases including:
    * Onboarding
    * Provisioning
    * Compromise Recovery
    * Updates
    * Decommissioning
    * Ownership Transfer
* Security Test Plans for Specifications
* Suggested Test Plans for Implementations
* Security Compliance Test Suite

# Deliverables
The WoT Security Task Force will not produce recommendation-track deliverables but will produce Working Group Notes on security in conformance with the [scope](#scope) of this document.  This will include specification reviews, use case reviews and security test plans.  Security test plans will focus on adversarial testing as opposed to functional testing.

In addition to these documents, the Security Task Force will establish and continually evolve a compliance test suite based on the security test plans.

# Relationships to Groups External To WoT
This task force will need to work with a number of different groups both within and without W3C to be successful.  Within W3C, this task force will need to work with:

* [W3C Security Activity](https://www.w3.org/Security/)
* Web of Things WG
* [Web of Things IG](https://www.w3.org/WoT/IG/)
* [Web of Things CG](https://www.w3.org/community/wot/)
* [Automotive WG](https://www.w3.org/auto/wg/)
* [Web Security IG](https://www.w3.org/2011/07/security-ig-charter.html)
* [Web Application Security WG](https://www.w3.org/2011/webappsec/)
* [Devices & Sensors WG](https://www.w3.org/2009/dap/)

Additionally, this task force will work with security experts from any external organization that is defined in the WoT WG charter. These will potentially include representatives from:

* [IETF](http://ietf.org)
* [OWASP](https://www.owasp.org)

# Participation
Participation by security experts from any W3C group is welcome.  They must meet the [good standing requirements](Good Standing requirements) of the W3C Process.  Additionally, this task force will work with security experts from any external organization for which a liaison has been established by the WG.

# Communication
The WoT Security TF will primarily conduct its work on the public mail list TBD.

The group will use the Web of Things Working Group home page to provide updated public information about its activities.

Information about the group (deliverables, participants, face-to-face meetings, teleconferences, etc.) is available from the Web of Things Working Group home page.

# Decision Policy
As Explained in the Process Document ([section 3.3](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/policies#Consensus)), this group will seek to make decisions when there is consensus.  In cases where there is a need to formally produce a group resolution about a particular issue, its Chair will put a question about the issue to the group and gather responses (including any formal objections); then, after due consideration of all the responses, the Chair will record a group resolution (possibly after a formal vote and also along with responding to any formal objections).

# Patent Policy
Participants in the WoT Security Task Force are obligated to comply with W3C patent-disclosure policy as outlined out in [Section 6](http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/#sec-Disclosure) of the W3C Patent Policy document. Although the Indic Text Layout Task Force is not chartered to produce Recommendation-track documents that themselves require patent disclosure, participants in the group are nevertheless obligated to comply with W3C patent-disclosure policy for any Recommendation-track specifications that they review or comment on.

For more information about disclosure obligations for this group, please see the W3C Patent [Policy Implementation](https://www.w3.org/2004/01/pp-impl/).
