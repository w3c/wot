<h3>Fujitsu Limited</h3>
<p>
  Fujitsu supports this specification to connect any kinds of devices used in a various fields 
and to lead them to operate from the cloud services. The WoT gateway can bring the devices to 
the WoT world easily, since it can provide adaptation functionality to convert their proprietary i
nterfaces to the WoT interface.

<h4 id="impl-fujitsu-gateway">Fujitsu WoT gateway: TD Producer and Consumer</h4>
<p>
The Fujitsu WoT gateway has an API similar to Scripting API. This API enables developers to 
make device adapters to convert their propriety interface to WoT and create applications to 
handle their devices using with WoT interface. These adapters can be attached and detached easily 
using with OSGi framework, since the adapters are developed as OSGi bundles (plug-ins) and 
installed to the WoT gateway just before the devices to be connected. 
</p>
<p>
Multi-layered gateways are effective for the large scale system. Mainly lower gateways can 
connect physical devices and upper gateways aggregate lower gateways. This configuration 
can cover the huge number of devices connected to widely deployed gateways. If the upper gateway
and lower gateways deploy on the cloud and on the local network respectively, for example, 
inside buildings, the applications can monitor and control the devices on the buildings 
beyond firewall and NAT. In the WoT plugfest, Fujitsu set up the upper gateway on the internet 
and the lower gateways on the local networks in the smart home and at the plugfests site.

<h4 id="impl-fujitsu-WoT-sensors">WoT sensors: TD Producer</h4>
<p>
The WoT sensors includes a Wi-Fi communication unit that has a WoT stack on it and easily make 
compatible WoT devices using sensors units. This communication unit has a common interface like 
I2C and GPIO for the connections. 
</p>
<h4 id="impl-fujitsu-legacy-adapter">Legacy devices with WoT adapters: TD Producer</h4>
<p>
Home appliances and facilities like window blinds in the smart home can be connected with adapters
to convert the propriety interface like ECHONET Lite to WoT. Rotating light that has EtherCAT interface 
can be done in the same way. 
</p>
<h4 id="impl-fujitsu-node-red">Node-RED including Node generators: TD Consumer</h4>
<p>
The pre-proccesing mechanism for Node-RED is supported to generate the nodes on Node-RED 
corresponding to the shadow devices on the WoT gateway. This is composed of a retriever of 
TDs on the gateway and the node generator provided by Hitachi and offers a good application
development environment to quickly set up.
