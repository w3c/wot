<h3>Oracle Corporation</h3>
<p>
Oracle supports this specification as it enables manufacturers of IoT cloud platforms and applications
to integrate devices across multiple vendors, who describe their features and functionality in a uniform way. 
This enables application scenarios that allow monitoring and control of devices from different manufacturers.
Flexible rules can be used to define alert conditions that trigger actions on devices based on sensor data from other devices.
Sensor data combined with big data analytics can be used to predict maintenance needs of devices
to prevent downtime.
</p>
<p>
A common way of describing devices grows the ecosystem of devices that can be easily integrated into 
cloud platforms out of the box and thus enables creating digital twins of physical devices
for asset monitoring, production monitoring, fleet management, and the management of buildings and smart cities.
</p>
<p>
Oracle offers an IoT Cloud Service that enables management of devices, messages and alerts.
This platform is complemented with cloud applications for asset monitoring, production monitoring, 
fleet management, connected workers and others.
The IoT Cloud Service interoperates with WoT servients as described in the sections below.
</p>

<h4 id="impl-oracle-converters">Thing Description to Device Model Converters: TD Consumer and Producer</h4>
<p>Oracle's IoT cloud platform defines a device model abstraction that is used to describe the common
behaviour of a class of devices via properties (attributes), actions, messages and alerts.
This format is similar to the WoT thing description and thing descriptions can be converted
to device models and vice versa.<br>
Devices that are managed by the IoT cloud platform can be expose using the WoT thing description format
and devices that are described via thing descriptions can be consumed from the IoT cloud service. 
Oracle provides open source implementations of converters to generate a device model from a thing description (td2dm)
and vice versa (dm2td).
</p>

<h4 id="impl-oracle-simulators">Oracle Digital Twin Simulator: TD Producer</h4>
<p> 
Oracle's IoT Cloud Service includes a simulator for devices which allows to model 
and test asset monitoring scenarios without having the physical device already available.
This allows experimenting with different device models and finding the right abstraction
before a device is actually manufacturered and thus reduce the implementation risk.
Various device simulations were provided by Oracle:
</p>
  
<ul>
<li>HVAC</li>  
<li>BluePump</li>
<li>Truck</li>
<li>Connected Car</li>  
</ul>

<p>
These simulations were exposed via TDs that were generated from device models using 
the converters above.
The simulator uses HTTP/REST with JSON to interact with the devices. 
To facilitate easy integration and interworking during the plug fests we used basic.
In real world scenarios typically OAuth2 is used.
</p>
<p>  
TD's for devices from other manufacterer were imported using the td2dm converter and
simulators were defined for the following devices:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Fujitsu's rotary beacon light</li>
<li>Intel's RGB light</li>
<li>Panasonic's air conditioner</li>
<li>Panasonic's hue light</li>
<li>Siemens Festo Plant</li>
<li>KETI environment sensor</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="impl-oracle-node-wot">Node-WoT with Oracle Binding: TD Consumer</h4>
<p> 
Node-WoT contains a binding to Oracle's IoT Cloud Service that was kindly developed by Matthias Kovatsch.
The binding uses Oracle's JavaScript client library that encapsulates Oracle's proprietary 
device to cloud communication protocol.
The integration allows node-wot to consume TDs for devices from other manufacturers and to read properties
and trigger actions on these devices.
</p>

<h4 id="impl-oracle-asset-monitoring">Oracle Asset Monitoring: Interoperability across Manufacturers</h4>
<p>
Oracle's Asset Monitoring application is used to define scenarios that combine devices from 
different manufacturers. Flexible rules trigger actions and issue alerts based on sensor data from 
other devices.<br>
In several scenarios (home, industrial, smart energy) devices from various manufacturers, 
including Fujitsu, Intel, Panasonic, KETI and others were integrated into a combined use case.
Devices include home devices (e.g. smart lamps, air conditioners, window blinds, cleaners, robots) and industrial devices
(e.g. alert lights, pumps, valves, liquid sensors, environment monitors, solar chargers, speech output).
These devices were controlled by rules that were triggered by events on various sensors, 
e.g. draining a tank when a critical environment condition happens, indicating the water level in a tank with RGB lamps
and a numeric display panel, and more.
