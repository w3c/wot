# Testing and Validation

## To Do

### Test Descriptions
* Update from 2016 and track/derive from current specification
* Confirm spec converage (all normative assertions should be covered)

### TD Validation
* Scriptable TD validation tests
* Investigate JSON-LD 1.1 tooling

### Implementation Validation
* Includes TD (instance) validation
* Scripting API (internal tests) – only if implemented in an implementation
* Network interface testing: Multi-instance and interop testing
* Binding protocol testing (but... not deliverables; pick some for testing)

Needs to apply to multiple implementations
* At least two separate implementations required

Security testing
* Penetration testing, e.g. of exposed web APIs

### Specification Testing
* Review normative statements
* Security review
