      <h1>Requirement for functional architecture of WoT</h1>
      <section>
        <h2>Flexibility</h2>
        <p>There is a wide variety of Physical devices configuration for WoT
          implementations.<br />
          Functional WoT architecture should be able to be mapped to and cover
          all of the variations.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Compatibility</h2>
        <p> We have already had many legacy IoT solutions and IoT
          standardization activities in many business fields.<br />
          Functional WoT architecture should provide bridge between legacy IoT
          solutions and Web technology based on WoT concepts. And it should
          guarantee to be upper compatible to legacy IoT solutions and current
          standards.<br />
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Safety and Security</h2>
        <p> Functional WoT architecture should have the room for providing
          safety and security functionalities.<br />
          In the IoT solutions, once cyber security barrier is hacked, it is
          more easily led to safety issues than conventional web solutions. That
          is because hacked IoT devices often treat heal cycle such as central
          heating systems, physical moving devices such as cars.<br />

      <h1>Mapping variations</h1>
      <p>In real world, there are many variations for mapping logical WoT
        servient to physical devices structure.<br />
        This chapter tries to list up informative mapping samples.</p>
      <section>
        <h2> Simple Use case</h2>
        <div  style="text-align: center;"><img  src="simple_use_case2.png"  alt="Simple use case"

             title="Simple use case"  style="width: 640px;" /></div>
        <p  style="text-align: center;">Fig.9 Simple use case</p>
        <p  style="text-align: left;">Fig.9 shows very simple use case such that
          a browser accessed WoT Servient to get some information of legacy
          device and/or put some parameters to control legacy device.<br />
          In this use case, browser’s App Script refers Things Description of
          WoT servient and get information of who it is, what kind of APIs it
          provides.<br />
          Then App Script calls client API provided by RunTime Environment and through resource model
          block and protocol binding block, the request is mapped on
          internet protocol such as HTTP, CoAP and so on.<br />
          The protocol accesses Server Connector block of WoT servient through WoT Interface. After that the
          request is transferred to App Script in WoT servient through protocol binding block
          and resource model block.<br />
          App Script understands what kind of request comes from browser and
          according to the request, App Script controls legacy device through
          Runtime Environment. In Fig.9 case, runtime environment calls legacy communication and access legacy device.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>WoT servient on device<br />
        </h2>
        <div  style="text-align: center;"><img  src="servient_on_device_itself2.png"

             alt="WoT Servient on device itself"  title="WoT Servient on device itself"

             style="width: 640px;" /></div>
        <p  style="text-align: center;">Fig.10 WoT Servient on device itself </p>
        <p  style="text-align: left;">The first example is WoT servient on
          device itself. This is referred as “WoT Device”.<br />
          The right most WoT servient in Fig.10 shows an LED Light which
          has rich CPU and large memory and provides web server functionality
          connected directly to internet.<br />
          Then the leftmost browser and/or another application on internet can
          access the LED light through internet directly.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>WoT servient on Smartphone</h2>
        <p>The second example is WoT servient on Smartphone.<br />
          Smartphone becomes very popular and it provides gateway functionality
          which bridges between internet and legacy device without any
          intermediate hardware.<br />
        </p>
        <div  style="text-align: center;"><img  src="servient_on_smartphone_a2.png"

             alt="WoT servient on Smartphone (A)"  title="WoT servient on Smartphone (A)" /></div>
        <p  style="text-align: center;">Fig.11 WoT servient on Smartphone (A)</p>
        <p  style="text-align: left;">Fig.11 shows an example of WoT servient on
          Smartphone. In Fig.11, there are independent 2 software modules, one is
          browser which has user experience to provide interaction, the the
          other is WoT servient which might not have any user interface and it
          provides gateway functionality to access legacy device.</p>
        <div  style="text-align: center;"><img  src="servient_on_smartphone_b2.png"

             alt="WoT servient on Smartphone (B)"  title="WoT servient on Smartphone (B)" /></div>
        <p  style="text-align: center;">Fig.12 WoT servient on Smartphone (B)</p>
        <p  style="text-align: left;">Fig.12 shows another example of WoT
          servient mapped on smartphone.<br />
          In this mapping case, a browser is expanded to include WoT servient
          functionality. Then there is no need for an app script to call web
          server block. Instead the client API should be called directly inside.</p>

        <p>Fig.13 shows an example of WoT servient on smart home hub.<br />
          Smart home hub is usually introduced home automation and/or home
          energy management solution.<br />
          Looking at consumer electronics, there are very wide variety of
          physical communication format such as WiFi, 802.15.4g, Bluetooth low
          energy, HDPLC and so on. In order to normalize those variations,
          almost all home systems introduce a smart home hub.<br />
          In Fig.13, WoT servient wraps the difference of communicating legacy
          devices and provides to other clients a universal devices accessing
          method.<br />
          In home inside, as the communication method between WoT servient on
          smart home hub and clients, WiFi is usually adopted.</p>

        <h2>WoT servient on Cloud Server</h2>
        <p>Client Apps can control devices at home through WoT servient on a
          Smart Home Hub. But the location of client Apps is restricted within
          home because physical communication path “WiFi” and/or wired Ethernet
          between smart home hub and client apps such as browser is limited
          inside home.<br />
          So, controlling devices at home from outside the house, WoT servient
          from a smart home hub should be mapped to a globally accessible cloud server.<br />

        <p  style="text-align: center;">Fig.14 WoT Servient on Cloud Server</p>
        <p  style="text-align: left;">Fig.14 shows an example of WoT servient on
          a cloud server.<br />
          In Fig.14 case, a browser accesses WoT servient on the cloud Server named
          “platform”. This WoT servient provides Things Description through
          internet globally. So, wherever browser user is, he/she can access
          this WoT servient.<br />
          WoT servient on "platform" accepts browser and/or other application’s request
          through HTTP, CoAP and so on. Then WoT Servient on the cloud server
          finds out the route to access the WoT servient on a smart home hub. In
          Fig.14 case, Things Description of WoT Servient on cloud server is
          mirror of that on the smart home hub.<br />
          After finding out the route, WoT Servient on the cloud server transfer
          browser’s request to WoT Servient on the smart home hub.<br />
          After that, the smart home hub processes the request according to
          Fig.13 case.<br />
          In this Fig.14 case, the smart home hub works as<br />
          a)    Unifier of very wide variety of legacy communication protocols
          both in the physical and logical view;<br />
          b)    Firewall between internet as WoT Servient on the cloud server
          and legacy connected devices at home;<br />
          c)    Privacy filter which substitutes real image and/or speech, and
          logs data at home to symbols;<br />
          d)    Autonomous WoT Servient which provides house inside the server,
          even if the connection is shut down between internet and the smart
          home hub;<br />
          e)    Emergency Apps running in a local environment when the fire
          alarm and similar event occur.</p>

      <h1>General Description of WoT Servient</h1>
      <p>In Web of Things (WoT), functional virtual device is named “WoT
        Servient” which provides the access to, control and get the status and
        values from IoT physical devices.<br />
        General WoT Servient functional architecture is presented in Fig.15</p>

        <p>Fig.15 Functional Architecture of WoT Servient</p>
        <p  style="text-align: left;">The role and functionality of each module
          is as follows;</p>
      </div>
      <section>
        <h2>Server Connector</h2>
        <p>server Connector accepts requests from networked clients through internet
          and sends responses to clients.</p>
        Examples of protocols between WoT servient and clients include HTTP,
        CoAP, MQTT and so on.<br />
        REST style API can be defined in front of the Server Connector module. This
        API is named “WoT Interface”. WoT Interface is the subject of the standardization
        activity. <br />
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Client Connector</h2>
        <p>WoT Servient can access other web servers and/or WoT servients
          through internet.<br />
          In these cases a Client Connector module communicates with other servers via
          protocols such as HTTP.<br />
          When Client Connector modules calls other WoT servients not legacy web
          servers, the API is provided through WoT Interface.<br />
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Legacy Communication</h2>
        <p> As described before, currently, there are many IoT services and
          standards proposed by many organizations.<br />
          In order to communicate such legacy devices, WoT servient includes
          legacy communication module for such protocols as Echonet Lite, QNX,
          ONVIF, DLNA and so on.<br />
         Legacy Communication inludes proprietly protocol binding mechanism and resource management defined by each protocol managing organizations.<br />
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Protocol Binding</h2>
        <p>Protocol Binding block converts interactions with devices using information in Things Description in accordance with lower layer protocols such as HTTP, CoAP, MQTT and so on.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Resource Model</h2>
        <p>Resource Model Provides a common abstraction across the different protocols.<br />
        Just like the Web, it allows to identify and address interaction points with URIs.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Things Description</h2>
        <p>Things Description declares providing API name, parameter type and so on.<br />
        External client refers this description to call WoT Interface.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>App Script</h2>
        <p>AppScripts implements application logic in a modular and portable way.<br />
        It can access local hardware, locally connected legacy devices, and remote things through the WoT Interface.<br />
        For this, the runtime environment must provide the Scripting API (Client, Server, Discovery and Proprietly(if any)).
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Runtime Environment</h2>
        <p>Runtime Environment provides the Scriptiong API<br />
        Sever API is the API for creating server functions which accepts request through WoT Interface from other clients.<br />
        Client API is the API for creating client functions which utilizes resource model, protocol binding and so on.
        Client API sometimes includes Physical API to manpulate I2C etc.<br />
        Discovery API is utility API to discover other Servers and/or WoT Servients.

      <h1>Conclusion</h1>
      <p>A functional architecture for WoT Servient is introduced in Fig.15. This
        functional architecture can explain well a wide variety of different WoT
        application scenarios.<br />
        As the next stage of the standardization, we should standardize the
        following 3 items.<br />
        1)    Protocol mapping for HTTP and so on that enable communication between a
        client and WoT Servient;<br />
        2)    Things Description to declare properties and capabilities of WoT
        Servient to the Web;<br />
        3)    Script APIs in runtime environment for Server, Client and Discovery to enable App scripts.</p>
