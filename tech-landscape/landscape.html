                            <strong>Background of the technology:</strong> RDFS defines simple semantics for RDF
                            data. It includes e.g. the concepts of class and subsumption relation between classes or
                            properties. It is intended to provide a baseline for other meta-vocabularies,

                            to allow more complex modeling and non-trivial automated reasoning. OWL
                            mostly relies on Description Logic (DL). It can have different levels of
                            complexity (called <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/owl-ref/#Sublanguages">profiles</a>).
                            A second version of OWL
                            (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2012/REC-owl2-syntax-20121211/">OWL 2</a>) was published
                            and new profiles were added, mostly to trade &quot;some expressive power for the
                            efficiency of reasoning&quot;.
                        </li>

                        OWL proved successful (especially in specific domains like biology) and many
                        Web vocabularies use it (see the LOV platoform for an overview). However, only
                        few of them take full advantage of its expressiveness.

                        <li><strong>Background of the technology:</strong> HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State) is part of the REST architectural style (uniform interface constraint). REST clients may not rely on typed resources or predefined (out-of-band) request definitions, but must receive the list of possible requests from the server. Hypermedia formats are providing these functional descriptions in-band through links and forms, which tell the client how to construct requests. Semantic information about the state transition when following a link or submitting a form is attached through the link relation type and respectively form relation type attribute. The types are managed in an IANA <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/link-relations/link-relations.xhtml">registry</a>. However, proper types for WoT applications are still missing.</li>

                            any and the structure of its content. It follows the principles of
                            design first and model-driven engineering to allow for more automation in

        <h2>Tech landscape for Thing discovery</h2>
        The aim of this technology landscape for discovery mechanisms for the Web of Things is to collect candidate discovery technologies, evaluate them, and to derive generic discovery interaction patterns. The list of discovery categories can be found in this <a href='#discoveryCategories'>section</a>. The identified discovery interaction patterns are presented in this <a href='#discoveryPatterns'>section</a>. An evaluation of identified technologies can be found in this <a href='#discoveryEvaluation'>section</a>. Further, we analyzed which discovery technologies are supported by which IoT consortia. This analysis can be found in this <a href='#discoveryConsortia'>section</a>.

                <h2> Searching across peers</h2>
                In peer to peer discovery, the directory is essentially distributed across the peers. This is often based upon distributed hash tables which maps the search space into a numeric range and then allocates servers to parts of that range. The technique works well for scale free networks. It requires Peers in the P2P overlay to host parts of the RD and to have full connectivity and certain computing power in order to forward overlay messages, keep a consistent DHT and routing tables in the node. P2P Overlays tolerate certain amounts of churn but it would be impractical for constrained devices to participate as full peers on the DHT.

            <h2>Evaluation of Discovery Technologies</h2>
            In the following, we analyze the identified discovery technologies according to a set of evaluation criteria. Those criteria are listed below.

            <p>
                <b>Evaluation Criteria</b>
                <ol>
                    <li>Interaction Pattern</li>
                    This criterion specifies whether a discovery technology complies with the identified interaction pattern in that discovery category.

                    <li>Support of higher layer discovery</li>
                    This criterion specifies whether a discovery technology provides means to submit search queries based on terms used in the underlying data model, so the thing description. This includes searches such as e.g.: 'search all things with name X' or 'search all things with property XYZ'.

                    <li>Bootstrapping</li>
                    This criterion specifies whether means are provided to start/interact with things after discovery.

                    <li>Lifetime / sleepy nodes</li>
                    This criterion specifies whether sleeping times of constrained devices are directly considered by the discovery technology.

                    <li>Range</li>
                    This criterion specifies the spatial extent within which a discovery technology is functioning. This is important for the category “finding things around me”.

                    <li>Support for (physically) local/remote discovery of things</li>
                    <li>Richness of query</li>
                    This criterion specifies to what extent contextual query parameters can be passed in a search query to discover things. E.g., this may include spatial parameters ('search all things in NYC') and temporal parameters ('search all things active yesterday'). In comparison to the criterion 'Support of higher layer discovery', this criterion looks at richer search query mechanisms that go beyond a basic search for terms of the thing description model.

                    <li>Ranking of results</li>
                    This criterion specifies how/if the discovery mechanism is capable of ranking search results.

                <p>
                    There are numerous exisiting web api frameworks that can or could serve as current practise,
                    e.g. refer to <a href="http://www.todobackend.com/">todobackend.com</a>

                    <li>
                        <a href="http://w3c.github.io/presentation-api/">W3C Presentation API</a>: The <a href="https://www.w3.org/2014/secondscreen/">W3C Second Screen Working Group</a> works on a specification of an API that enables web content to access external presentation displays and use them for presenting web content. The specification aims to make presentation displays such as projectors or connected TVs, available to the Web and takes into account displays that are attached using wired (HDMI, DVI, or similar) and wireless technologies (Miracast, Chromecast, DLNA, AirPlay, or similar), but the Presentation API abstracts from these underlying protocols. It allows Browser vendors to implement the API on top of different protocols. The specification describes the conformance criteria for two classes of user agents:</b>
                        Controlling user agent: Web browsers that conform to the specifications of a controlling user agent must be able to monitor the availability of presentation displays, start new presentations, join or reconnect to running presentations and to exchange messages and binary data with presentations.</b>
                        Receiving user agent: Web browsers that conform to the specifications of a receiving user agent must be able to render presentations by providing the necessary inferfaces to accept launch or join requests from controlling user agents and to exchange messages and binary data with controlling pages.</b>
                        The concept of the Presentation API is relevant to the work of the this group since the WoT Thing API is intended to offer an API that abstracts from the underlying IoT protocols. The Presentation API can be seen as a concrete case of the generic Thing API if we consider presentation displays as kind of things that provide Thing Description with the necessary set of actions, properties and events to start and control presentations.

        <h2>Tech landscape for Security&Privacy</h2>
        <p>
            While things may be of low value (say <50$) they can control (parts of) high value assets such as smart locks controlling access to homes or offices/factories. WoT aims at exposing the functonality of such things at public-facing endpoints in the Internet/Web. This establishes <b>security</b> as a top concern for WoT.<br /><br />
            Things can reveal/expose data related to user habits such as lightning/heating practices or the human body such as heartbeat rates. This establishes <b>privacy</b> as another top concern for WoT. In the first place this refers to things owned/used by individuals esp. consumer goods. Privacy can also concern things owned/used by legal entities e.g. capital/investment goods such as health care equipment. But not all things owned/used by legal entities are subject to privacy concerns. There also are WoT scenarios which do not process individual user data such as industrial control systems.<br /><br />
            This chapter provides the security&privacy landscape for WoT.

            <h2>Takeaway</h2>
            <p>
                The WoT provides distributed IT-systems. The study of protecting distributed IT-systems started soon after their invention i.e. in the 60/70ies. So there is lots of prior art for security&privacy - collectively providing the current toolbox. But WoT needs security&privacy tools that are not yet present in the current toolbox. New security&privacy tools for WoT will come in 2 forms:
                <ul>
                    <li>New tools that change form-factors of existing tools (smaller, lighter...) i.e. tools doing known tricks in new forms</li>
                    <li>New tools doing new tricks</li>
                </ul>
                These new security&privacy tools need to come as (broadly resp. industry/domain-wide accepted) standards. These standards do not yet exist, they do emerge right now.
                This chapter elaborates on this hypothesis.

            <h2>Inclusion of Physical Goods and Processes</h2>
            <p>
                The inclusion of physical goods and processes is the key differentiator between the Web-of-Things on the on hand and the Web-of-Services resp. the traditional Web (<i>Web-of-Pages</i>) on the other hand.<br /><br />
                There are Web-of-Services and Web-of-Pages security&privacy requirements which translate to Web-of-Things in a straight-forward manner such as <i>user authentication->thing authentication</i>. For such requirements security&privacy mechanisms were established by other domains such as office/enterprise IT or Cloud computing. Corresponding standards and best practices do exist and may apply or may be translated to WoT. Note that constraints (number of instances, computing power, memory, IO and networking capabilities etc.) do change when considering the WoT image of a traditional requirement such as the authentication of a caller.<br /><br />
                The inclusion of physical goods and processes also leads to security&privacy requirements or constraints with no real/good analogies in the digital World. These requirements resp. constraints are not yet covered by security&privacy technologies developed for existing domains. This includes security&privacy requirements as well as constraints such as:
                <ul>
                    <li>Things discovery authorization</li>
                    <li>Managing the authorization to authorize</li>
                    <li>Software esp. firmware update/patching</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Standardization</h2>
            <p>
                The W3C IG WoT is considering same as well as cross-domain interactions among resp. with things:
                <ul>
                    <li>For interactions in the same-domain standards for security facilitate reuse - they are nice-to-have</li>
                    <li>For interactions that cross domains (i.e. there is no single vendor/provider that designs/produces/supplies all components that interact in a WoT scenario) standards for security (authentication and authorization, secure communications provide interoperability AND reuse - they are must-haves</li>
                </ul>
                Thus, standards for security&privacy are mandatory for WoT. This refers to conventions for implementing security&privacy that are broadly resp. industry or application domain-wide accepted.<br /><br />
                The state-of-the-art survey provided in this landscape document does consider existing and emerging standards for WoT security&privacy.

            <h2>Technology Origin/Heritage</h2>
            <p>
                Numerous security&privacy-enabling tools do already exist. Prominent examples are Kerberos, SSL/TLS and OAuth. They were created to serve the needs encountered in office/enterprise IT (e.g. Kerberos), the classical Web (e.g. SSL/TLS) as well as new Web application styles esp. service-oriented applications, apps/REST APIs (e.g. OAuth). The corresponding mechanisms often are very mature i.e. they represent broadly accepted standards that are in large-scale production use.<br /><br />
                This prior-art can help to address security&privacy for (parts of) WoT scenarios. But there is no guarantee that a (mature) security or privacy means with non-WoT origin/heritage does present a good match for WoT. For security/privacy mechanisms with non-WoT origin, fitness checks are needed.<br /><br />
                Security&privacy mechanism with WoT or IoT origin are work-in-progress nowadays. They do not yet present the same maturity level (not yet broadly accepted standards, not yet in large-scale protection use). Hence (and for the time being) maturity checks are needed for security/privacy mechanisms with WoT origin.</a>

            <h2>Architectural Impact</h2>
            <p>
                Different security&privacy tools do have different impact on the architecture and implementation of WoT systems:
                <ul>
                    <li>Some affect the core from solution design and realization perspective e.g. the authorization of actions and the authentication of actors. For instance this includes cross-cutting concerns such as the representation and handling of authenticated callers throughout a codebase.</li>
                    <li>Other security mechanisms are more peripheral i.e. can be added or replaced easily. This especially holds for transport-oriented security mechanisms such as SSL/TLS and DTLS.</li>
                </ul>
                The former mechanisms require more attention during the architecture and design process than the latter.

            <h2>Distribution of Complexity</h2>
            <p>
                Mechanisms invented <2010 for distributed IT-System security e.g. Kerberos, SSL/TLS, SAML happen to distribute logical and computational complexity quite evenly over client and server components.<br /><br />
                This was a major issue for the Web app/API economy where 3rd pary developers create components (e.g. mobile apps) that interact with services provided by other parties. To overcome this obstacle the new generation security resp. security-enabling technologies invented >2010 (e.g. OAuth) distribute complexity unevenly:
                <ul>
                    <li>The server or responder-side (e.g. OAuth authorization server) usually is as complex as in classical approaches (e.g. SAML IdP)</li>
                    <li>The client or requestor-side (e.g. OAuth client) complexity is orders of magnitude smaller than in classical approaches (e.g. SAML RP) This simplifies the security resp. security-enabling stack that has to be provided on client-side.</li>
                </ul>The new approach tends to be a better fit for WoT than technologies with an even distribution of complexity.

            <h2>Wrap-Up</h2>
            <p>
                As of today there are no broadly accepted protocol standards for authenticating and authorizing things. Current projects do either not address these challenges or create silos.<br />
                The IETF ACE working group happens to be the leading initiative in order to overcome this limitation:
                <ul>
                    <li>ACE has a sound problem statement and high-level approach</li>
                    <li>
                        But ACE does not yet provide a solution - for the time being a plethora of not-yet-integrated approaches for expressing access tokens as well as acquiring them in request/response protocols are being discussed. The current stage of elaboration should be regarded "brainstorming". Moreover, questions around system dynamics (on and offboarding of components) and bootstrapping are not yet fully illuminated. This includes aspects such as creation/management of token issuance policies (in a possibly automated fashion), protecting component (self-)registration, managing the authorization to authorize, things discovery authorization
                    </li>
                </ul>
                From the perspective of the W3C IG WoT the (to-be-established) protocol standards for the authorization of actions and the authentication of actors in WoT should address/enable:
                <ul>
                    <li>A variety of security token types for different application domains/use cases (consumer/industry), security models (enc/sign, bearer/PoP), encodings (JSON, CBOR...), topologies (3/4/n-party), delivery models (by-value, by-ref). The corresponding ecosystem needs to be extensible and allow to create-your-own security token type in case the already defined ones do not solve your issue.</li>
                    <li>A (single) request/response framework for acquiring and handling such tokens with different protocol bindings (HTTP/CoAP...). Request/response messages and security token (type) specifications should be decoupled i.e. the same request/response framework should allow the handling of various security token types. The corresponding framework needs to be extensible and allows to create-your-own exchange in case the already defined ones do not solve your issue.</li>
                </ul>
                For secure communications on transport-level, DTLS as well as TLS present commonly accepted standards. Their profiling/optimization for constrained devices and networks is a task that is currently ongoing. Note that securing communications on transport-level comes with limitations in the end-to-end security span which is achievable. For secure communications on application-level and secure storage, standards do exist for representing encrypted and signed data in JSON (a form-factor not suitable for very constrained components). Corresponding work is ongoing for CBOR (a form-factor suitable for very constrained components).<br /><br />
                Moreover there are no commonly accepted standards for registering things resp. devices and supplying identity (meta-)data and credentials about things resp. devices as of now.

        <h2>Tech landscape for decentralised P2P IoT</h2>

        <p>A decentralised, peer-to-peer (P2P) system is a collection of applications run on several local computers, which connect remotely to each other to complete a function or a task. A decentralised peer to peer overlay network manages connections between human and Internet of Things peers. The participants in the network are the peer nodes. The peer to peer network is scalable and an unlimited number of nodes can participate in the network.</p>
        <p>Centralized corporate owned cloud is certainly an easier way to build out IoT platforms; however, the owners, application service providers, cloud service providers and authorities of these topologies have an influence upon the network and can exploit it. They can ban devices, spy on devices, and compromise the data integrity of the devices. In fact, the government can order the cloud service operators and centralised application providers to do all of these things.</p>
        <p>In the near future, the doors, air condition units, and security system of homes will be fully internet connected. The users will be able to control their home automation system from a mobile phone device. It is essential that only the end user has full control over the IoT devices. Decentralised P2P Internet of Things aims to provide users with such exclusive and full control.</p>

        <p>The following areas are in scope for decentralised P2P IoT</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Security, including authentication, access control and data integrity</li>
            <li>Existing and new standards</li>
            <li>Protocols</li>
            <li>Device discovery</li>
            <li>Interoperability with client/server systems</li>
        </ul>
