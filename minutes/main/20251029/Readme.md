Summary

## W3C Calendar Time Zone Discussion

The meeting began with a discussion about time zone handling in the W3C calendar, where Ege explained that the calendar detects and displays browser time zones while maintaining original time slots, though issues arise during time zone shifts. The group then discussed the potential benefits of using Unix time universally, with Michael noting that while this proposal was considered, people struggled with the concept of varied sleep schedules. Dave mentioned that they had enough material to address the issue of publishing the TD tomorrow, and the conversation ended with Michael suggesting that Ege take notes and manage IRC, while Dave mentioned reviewing a pull request for meeting minutes.

## Membership Changes and Platform Updates

The group discussed the addition of Kaz as an invited expert, with Dave confirming his support and noting that Kaz will attend TPAC. They addressed concerns about membership numbers, with Ege mentioning that Fraunhofer has joined the working group and Microsoft plans to make a significant announcement about their use of Thing Description in the Azure platform. The group also discussed the departure of Zoltan from Intel, who may apply for invited expert status to continue contributing to the scripting API. Dave suggested that new members and changes could be used as opportunities to gain attention during the rechartering process.

## Charter Extension and Policy Updates

The group discussed the formal announcement of a charter extension, which was necessary for publishing documents. They agreed to prepare a story around the next chartering once it's approved. Ege raised concerns about inactive invited experts and suggested implementing a policy to remove them after a 6-month period of inactivity. The team decided to work on this policy for the new charter, but Ege suggested it could be implemented immediately. They also discussed the process for reviewing and approving meeting minutes, with a new pull request system in place.

## Minutes Approval and Namespace Discussion

The team discussed the minutes process and decided to approve them without a detailed review, as per the usual asynchronous review policy. They agreed to merge the pull requests for the minutes and address any typo fixes offline. Michael and Ege mentioned that they would continue the discussion on the minutes process in another meeting. Ben interrupted to remind the team to approve the minutes, which they did without objections. The team also briefly touched on the topic of namespaces for TD2.0, which was mentioned by Dave and would be discussed later in the agenda.

## Fixing TD2.0 Namespace Links

The team discussed issues with broken links in the TD2.0 document related to namespaces. Ege explained the current situation with redirection rules and repository management, highlighting confusion about namespace handling and the existence of duplicate resources. Dave proposed a short-term solution involving merging a pull request to fix the broken links, allowing the document to be published the next day. The group agreed to address long-term repository management decisions in the future, considering whether to keep files in their own repository or move them to the W3C server.

## Publication Status and TPAC Planning

The team discussed the status of publications and agreed to focus on short-term solutions for tomorrow while deferring long-term policy decisions to TPAC or later. Dave will check with Dennis about updating the profile's working draft URL and history link on the webmaster's end. The team decided to wait until TPAC to resolve publishing the updated use case note document. They briefly touched on TPAC planning, noting a joint meeting with the JSON LD group and no urgent items requiring immediate attention this week.

## TPAC Remote Participation Challenges

The team discussed the TPAC schedule and remote participation challenges, particularly for participants in different time zones. They noted that Michael Cluster would be able to join most sessions, while Ben and Daniel might have difficulty with early morning slots. Ben explained he was not registered for TPAC due to funding issues and time zone challenges. The group considered rescheduling the profile joint meeting with JSONLD to accommodate remote participants. They also mentioned an upcoming profiles call and TD call.
