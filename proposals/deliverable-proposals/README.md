# Deliverable Proposals
Descriptions of possible deliverables for the next charter.   Please submit prior to the 
TPAC Pre-meeting so we can put them on the agenda for discussion.

Note you can use basic HTML inside an MD file (github will render it),
and we eventually need HTML for the charter,
so use HTML if possible for the actual content. 
Just put a blank line before and after and avoid blank lines in the middle of
any HTML content.
