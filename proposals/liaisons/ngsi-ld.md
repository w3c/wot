# [DRAFT] WoT WG/ETSI ISG CIM Simple Liaison for NGSI-LD
The purpose of this liaison 
will be to gain a better understanding of our respective activities
and look for opportunities to work together. 


## ETSI ISG Context Information Management
As part of its mission, the ETSI Industry Specification Group on cross-cutting Context Information Management (ISG CIM) drives the specification of an Application Programming Interface Specification/API, named NGSI-LD, which aims to enable applications to discover, access, update and manage data and context information from many different sources making it the interface of choice for getting access to Digital Twins data and managing their capabilities. 

## Purpose 
The goal of the liaison is to evaluate the potential of using W3C WoT Things Models for the description of  NGSI-LD entity types as well as specifying how default WoT Things Descriptions can be derived from WoT Things Models using the NGSI-LD API as the form to interact with Things.

## Participants
The liaison proposal has emerged from informal discussion between W3C WoT and ETSI ISG CIM representatives.

**Contacts from W3C WoT are:**
* Kaz Ashimura - W3C - WoT WG Staff Contact
* Michael McCool - Intel - WoT WG co-Chair
* Sebastian Kaebisch - Siemens - WoT WG co-Chair
* Michael Koster - W3C Invited Expert - WoT WG co-Chair

**Contacts from ETSI ISG CIM are:**
* Franck Le Gall - EGM - ETSI ISG CIM chair
* Martin Bauer - NEC - ETSI ISG CIM Vice chair
* Juanjo Hierro - Freelance - Chair of FIWARE TSC


## Scope 
What work needs to be done, by whom?
* W3C WoT WG to develop, in collaboration with ETSI ISG CIM,
  a NGSI-LD Binding that defines what information is needed in a
  Thing Description to communicate with an NSGI-LD Context Broker and access specific Things/NGSI-LD Entities.
* ETSI ISG CIM to develop, in collaboration with the WoT WG,
  extensions of existing specifications to include the use of a WoT Thing Description for NGSI-LD model descriptions

## Deliverables 
The following have been discussed but have not been formally agreed to.
* NGSI-LD API Binding Document as W3C Note
   - Alternatives with more details:
       * NGSI-LD API Binding Document as W3C Note describing how instance-specific information for WoT Thing Descriptions are 
         derived from a WoT Thing Model using NGSI-LD as a mechanism to interact with Things
       * NGSI-LD API Binding Document as W3C Note describing how to use NGSI-LD to interact with Things
       * NGSI-LD API Binding Document as W3C Note describing what information is needed to interact with an NGSI-LD service
* Extend ETSI GR-055 or another document to include the use of WoT Thing Description for NGSI-LD model description
