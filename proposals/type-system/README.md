# Expressing data types in a Thing Description

Thing description allows one to define a type for input and output values
(e.g., valueType). We need to allow for
- simple types and
- composed types (a.k.a. complex types)

The original idea was to base simple types on XML schema datatypes just like RDF
does (e.g., xsd:integer) and composed types based on schema.org.

That said using XSD datatypes seems to implicitly match to a given
representation (e.g., xsd:byte) while still not providing an easy way to limit
ranges or enumerate values without requiring the full power of XML schema.

Goal
- express how JSON payload MUST look like
- do not prohibit mappings to other formats than JSON (e.g., XML)
- enable semantic annotation of type definition

## Note on RDF data types

It is allowed (but not recommended) to associate a literal to any type
definition that has a URI (even without precise semantics). Still, a dedicated
mechanism to define complex types is needed: there is no way to specifiy the
nature of the data type on a literal.

Refering to arbitrary XSD schema is allowed, as long as schema components
define an ID. The other proposed solution was with XSCD, which never reached
the recommendation status, though.

OWL allows restriction on RDF-compatible XSD types. Structured values, such as
JSON objects should be expressed as classes. A simpler type declaration would
be beneficial.

## Other schemas

### Schema.org

Schema.org allow for refering to existing types but introduces
another concept by linking to types defined
elsewhere. Coming up with user-defined types does not seem to be very easy also.

### JSON Schema

Using JSON schema in both cases, simple types and composed
types, seems a reasonable/possible approach.

## Next steps

JSON Schema appears a good candidate and it is recommended for complex data
type specification. However, it still needs to be mapped to RDF, so that type
definitions can be semantically annotated.

Moreover, further languages have been proposed
([CDDL](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-greevenbosch-appsawg-cbor-cddl-08),
[YANG](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-netmod-rfc6020bis-12))
that still need to be reviewed.


## Mappings to Encodings

### Mapping to JSON/CBOR/EXIforJSON

By means of JSON schema mapping to JSON instances seems straightforward. 

One question that remains is whether JSON payload needs to be wrapped in one way or the other. 


| Not wrapped   | Wrapped (e.g., [TD-Tutorial](https://github.com/w3c/wot/blob/master/TF-TD/Tutorial.md))   |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `123`         | `{ "value": 123 }`  |


### Mapping to XML/EXI


Mapping to XML could be done by transforming JSON schema to XML schema first. The XML schema defines then the structure of the XML document. Also, the XML schema can be used for efficient XML representations such as EXI.

The following is an example JSON schema defining a JSON object.

```javascript
{
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "id": {
            "type": "integer"
        },
        "name": {
            "type": "string"
        }
    },
    "required": ["id"]
}
```

transforms to 

```xml
<xs:schema xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">
    <xs:element name="value">
        <xs:complexType>
            <xs:all>
                <xs:element name="id" type="xs:integer" minOccurs="1" />
                <xs:element name="name" type="xs:string" />
            </xs:all>
        </xs:complexType>
    </xs:element>
</xs:schema>
```

Note1: JSON schema does NOT define any order. That said, we would need to use xsd:all constructs instead of xsd:sequence. 

Here is another example JSON schema defining a JSON array.

```javascript
{
    "type": "array",
    "items": {
        "type" : "number"
    },
    "minOccurs" : 2,
    "minOccurs" : 3
}
```

transforms to the following XML schema when the array is anonymous.

```xml
<xs:element name="array" xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">
    <xs:complexType>
        <xs:sequence>
            <xs:element name="value" type="xs:double" minOccurs="2" minOccurs="3" />
        </xs:sequence>
    </xs:complexType>
</xs:element>
```

Otherwise (i.e. the array has a name), transforms to the following XML schema, where *__name* is the name of the array.

```xml
<xs:element name="__name" xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">
    <xs:complexType>
        <xs:sequence>
            <xs:element name="array">
                <xs:complexType>
                    <xs:sequence>
                        <xs:element name="value" type="xs:double" minOccurs="2" minOccurs="3" />
                    </xs:sequence>
                </xs:complexType>
            </xs:element>
        </xs:sequence>
    </xs:complexType>
</xs:element>
```

XML does not provide intrinsic support for arrays. For this reason, XML 
elements that is meant to represent an array communicate that by carrying
an attribute *jsonType* of value "array".

Note3: A complete "JSON Schema" to "XML Schema" mapping needs to be defined.
