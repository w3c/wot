# Goals
Subgoals will include:
* Enabling the use of web technologies enabled by the W3C WoT recommendations to OCF devices
* Reconcile OCF data model and information provided in the W3C WoT Thing Description
* Defining common semantic vocabulary (ontology), data, and interaction models
  * Linking to external ontologies and data models
* Demonstrate access to OCF resources from W3C WoT interfaces
  * Prototypes and POCs

# Benefits
Benefits to OCF of this liaison will include:
* Connection to the other web capabilities enabled by W3C standards
  * Ex: semantic web, MMI, geolocation, RDF, web services, web id, etc.
* Provide additional descriptive capabilities beyond the OCF data models
  * Enabling new capabilities, such as service composition, advanced development models, etc.

Benefits to W3C WoT of this liaison will include:
* Driving concrete use cases for Thing Description
* Extending the applicability of W3C WoT recommendations to the OCF ecosystem
* Allowing use of OCF devices as test cases for the WoT specification

# Scope
The OCF/WoT Liaison Task Force is responsible for:
* Ensuring W3C WoT WG recommendations can interoperate with and enable OCF devices
* Reviewing evolving OCF public standards and advising the WoT on strategic direction
* Communicating with the OCF on evolving W3C WoT work

# Deliverables 
In each of the four major deliverables of the W3C WoT WG,
the OCF/WoT Liaison Task Force will review and provide input on recommendation-track deliverables,
working with other WoT IG and WG Task Forces as appropriate:
* Recommend an W3C WoT protocol Binding Template for OCF protocols
* Work with the Thing Description TF to ensure Thing Descriptions can describe OCF Devices
* Work with the Scripting TF to ensure that OCF Devices can be accessed from W3C WoT Scripting API
* Work with the Security TF to enable end-to-end security when using W3C WoT in combination with OCF
* Work with other IG TFs as appropriate to enhance interoperability
* Generate recommendations to OCF to improve interoperability with W3C WoT standards

# Relationships to External Groups
This task force will need to work with the OCF.
Recommendations to the W3C WoT will only be released once the corresponding OCF standard is public.
However, all members of this task force will also be OCF members and so will have access to pre-publication
versions of the proposed OCF standards.
This will allow them to develop proposals as the OCF standards develop.

# Participation
Members of this Task Force need to also be members of OCF.
As OCF membership is based on organizations, not individual, in practice this means that a member of
this Task Force may not themselves be individually active in the OCF, although this is preferrable.

# Communication
The WoT/OCF Liaison TF will primairly conduct its work in closed meetings due to the need to follow
the IP rules set by OCF.
However, they will produce documents that can be released to and discussed
with the rest of the W3C WoT IG and WG once the corresponding OCF standards have been made public.
Additional communications may also be released after review by other OCF members; the members of this
group will also be members of an OCF/WoT Liaison task force within the OCF.

The task force will use the Web of Things Working Group home page to provide updated public information about its activities.

Information about the group (deliverables, participants, face-to-face meetings, teleconfrences, etc.)
will be made available from the Web of Things Working Group home page, although access to meetings and minutes
will be restricted according to the policy noted above.

# Decision Policy
As Explained in the Process Document ([section 3.3](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/policies#Consensus)),
this group will seek to make decisions when there is consensus.
In cases where there is a need to formally produce a group resolution about a particular issue,
its Chair will put a question about the issue to the group and gather responses (including any formal objections);
then, after due consideration of all the responses,
the Chair will record a group resolution (possibly after a formal vote and also along with responding to any formal objections).

# About This Charter
This charter for the Task Force within the Web of Things WG has been created according to
[section 6.2](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/groups#GAGeneral)
of the [Process Document](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process).
In the event of a conflict between this document or the provisions of any charter and the W3C Process,
the W3C Process shall take precedence.
