        <title>Building Automation</title>
        <p>Buildings often have a large variety of components such as Heating, Venting, and Air Conditioning (HVAC), lighting systems, and possibly more specialized systems such as support for reserving rooms electronically. Very often, these systems are not provided by a single supplier. Instead, landscapes of heterogeneous systems develop over time. Interoperability becomes a paramount challenge, as there should be a single way how interactions with the overall building automation infrastructure are possible. Furthermore, sensors, controllers, and actors of one system serving one specific use case can be useful for other use cases and can also enable new cross-domain applications and services to amplify comfort, security, and operational efficiency in smart buildings.</p>
        <p>Building automation scenarios can have layered services,for example when it comes to temperature sensing. While the basic functionality of the system might only include getting information about the current temperature in a variety of places, there might also be a "temperature history" service. This service might allow more advanced features such as accessing the complete history of temperature measurements, and possible even more advanced functionality such as queries in this dataset. By combining available data (e.g. weather forecast and occupancy of meeting rooms), room temperatures and future cooling/heating demand can be predicted to increase (e.g. an office building's) energy efficiency. Again, such an advanced service should be accessible in the same way as the more basic services, so that developers can access all these services in a uniform way.</p>

            <li reqref="resource-description">Applications may want to get an understanding of what kind of sensors and other capabilities are exposed as part of the building automation system. In such a case, it is necessary that available resources can be described or are describing themselves, preferably using a framework that makes those descriptions uniform even if the underlying sensors or services are using different implementations and communication technologies.</li>
            <li reqref="push">Applications may want to be notified of certain events in the building automation system, without having to listen to a continuous event stream from it. In such a case, it is advantageous for the system to support some kind of push mechanism, so that applications can subscribe to these events and will be notified when they happen. This increases the workload of the building automation system (it has to keep track of subscribers), but may make development of certain classes of applications much easier.</li>

        <p>An industrial automation systems (IAS) needs to be managed throughout different phases of its lifecycle, e.g., development, engineering, operation, maintenance, optimization, and other phases. The lifecycle management is a challenging task due to various reasons. For instance, it is a task that involves various stakeholders (e.g., domain engineers, software engineers, system engineers, system installers etc.) and hence it is an error-prone task, it is often handled in a safety critical environment, it needs to be maintained over a longer timeframe (during which some of the stakeholders or parts of the system may not be available) and so forth.</p>
        <p>Let us consider a use case scenario which, throughout the lifecycle management of an IAS, considers following tasks: Development of a new automation function, service or an app based on available resources and domain knowledge; Support for resource discovery, optimal selection and choreography of resources; Parametrization of resources, functions, services and apps; Support for adaptive services running in a dynamic environment (i.e., physical resources appear and disappear); Monitoring and diagnosis of resources, functions, services and apps; Optimization of automation workflows involving different resources and different lifecycle phases.</p>

The agent runs in the cloud, but is able to communicate through the firewall with devices in Joan’s home via her home hub. This was set up automatically when she first plugged the machine in. The washing machine has a very limited embedded controller. It suffices to run the desired washing and drying cycle, and has sensors that monitor its operation and enable components that are wearing out to be detected before they fail.

        <title>Remote health monitoring system</title>
        <p>John is retired and lives alone in his own apartment. He has bad legs and there is a constant risk that he falls. If that happens he is not able to rise from the floor without help. In addition, John suffers from heart arrhythmias and diabetes.</p>
        <p>Due to John's condition he needs remote monitoring by his healthcare provider. He therefore wears a wristband capable of continuously monitoring his heart rate and detect irregular heart rhythms as well as detecting a fall situation. A future version of the wristband will also be capable of non-invasive monitoring of his blood glucose level. The wristband communicates wirelessly with John's healthcare provider. This remote monitoring system could be seen as a complement to a normal home alarm system for elderly people with which old people can manually call an emergency service. The differences are that the wristband system detects severe conditions automatically, which is needed if the person is confused or is unconscious, and also has the possibility to measure medical parameters such as heart rate and heart rhythm.</p>

            <p>When the system is in operation everything works automatically without any user interface. The remote monitoring application runs in a cloud server and can communicate with the wristband. A local router, situated for example in a Smartphone, may be needed to translate between a local communication method such as Bluetooth Low Energy and the mobile network or wifi, but at application level end-to-end security and communication through firewalls are achieved. The communication must be reliable and the power consumption in the wristband low to achieve long battery life.</p>
            <p>User interaction is only required at system installation. The user, or another trusted person, e.g. a relative, health care personnel or personal assistant, has to use a web browser to log in to the remote monitoring application and the user has to approve that the application has access to his/her wristband using an existing authorization system, e.g. OAuth.</p>
            <p>To provide service discovery for applications the wristband, during the system installation, is registered in a discovery service that contains a service description for the wristband. This service description states for example manufacturer, owner and the APIs to access the resources of the wristband.</p>

Ebele uses her mobile phone to consult the doctor who is a clinic in a town eighty kilometers away. The doctor asks her to perform an ECG on Imani. She attaches the electrodes to Imani's chest and plugs them into the remote ECG monitor. This streams the data in real time over the mobile network to the clinic where the doctor is based.

        <title>Intelligent Hotel Room </title>
        <p>Katherine is a frequent business traveler. She stays in a variety of
            different hotels in many cities and different countries. In each hotel room
            she is able to control the lighting, heating/air conditioning, locks, alarm
            clock, water temperature and entertainment in her room. If someone knocks
            on the door she can see who's there from the TV or from her phone (a
            security camera is outside her door). Control is available from her mobile
            device, or she may be able to interact with the hotel room's services
            through an ambient device located in the room. It is important for user
            satisfaction for Katherine to get immediate access to these services when
            she checks in (without installing hotel-specific software), but it's also
            important that she not have access after she checks out. She doesn't have
            time to learn a new user interface for every hotel, or even every hotel
            chain, that she stays in, because she stays in so many different places. </p>
        <p>The user should also be able to control the room remotely through her mobile
            device; for example, she would like to be able to warm up the room when she
            is within a half hour or so of arriving back from dinner. This would support
            energy savings because the room could be colder when no one is there.
            Similarly, geofencing could also be used to turn on the lights when she's
            approaching the room. </p>
        <p>The user would also like to have her preferences made known when she checks
            in. For example, the room should automatically know her preferred room
            temperature, preferred units (metric vs. imperial), and her preferred
            language. However, her preferences may have to be overridden by the hotel
            (for example, if she prefers a temperature that is too high or too low, or
            if her preferred language is not available). In that case, she needs to be
            informed that her preferences can't be met and she should be offered
            alternatives. </p>
        <p>Privacy is also important in this use case. For example, the user doesn't
            want it to be generally known whether or not she's in the room. Security is
            important for preventing unauthorized access to the room or its services. </p>
        <p>The user sometimes also shares a hotel room with a colleague, in which case
            both occupants need to have access to the same capabilities. </p>

        <p>The default interaction in most Web-based scenarios are pull interactions, where applications request information form servers. This pattern supports scalability very well, because servers do not need to keep track of clients. However, in some scenarios it may be advantageous for this interaction pattern to be reversed, with servers (i.e., the managing entities of resources) initiating an interaction for certain resource-based events. These push interactions require servers to keep track of clients (often referred to as "subscribers"), but on the other hand minimizes interactions when resource events are infrequent but should be noticed by clients as soon as possible.</p>

        <p>RDF is a standard model for data interchange on the Web. RDF has features that facilitate data merging even if the underlying schemas differ, and it specifically supports the evolution of schemas over time without requiring all the data consumers to be changed. RDF extends the linking structure of the Web to use URIs to name the relationship between things as well as the two ends of the link (this is usually referred to as a “triple”). Using this simple model, it allows structured and semi-structured data to be mixed, exposed, and shared across different applications. This linking structure forms a directed, labeled graph, where the edges represent the named link between two resources, represented by the graph nodes. This graph view is the easiest possible mental model for RDF and is often used in easy-to-understand visual explanations.</p>

This is facilitated by using URIs as identifiers, and by using attribute/value pairs that make statements about those URI-identified resources. RDF descriptions can be of arbitrary complexity by joining triples to form a graph, and they can use and combine various vocabularies so that the graph contains information according to the concepts defined in those vocabularies.</li>

        <title>Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP)</title>
        <p>The Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) is an application profile of the Extensible Markup Language (XML) that enables the near-real-time exchange of structured yet extensible data between any two or more network entities. This document defines XMPP's core protocol methods: setup and teardown of XML streams, channel encryption, authentication, error handling, and communication primitives for messaging, network availability ("presence"), and request-response interactions.</p>
        <ul>
            <li reqref="push">being based on a bidirectional link, XMPP offers a standardized publish/subscribe scheme</li>
            <li reqref="layered-comm">The protocol consists of a link layer that can be TCP/TLS, BOSH or WebSocket, and an XML-based protocol on top of it</li>
            <li reqref="data-exchange-format">The protocol and payloads are described as XML Schemas, enabling other serializations (such as xmpp-ftw in JSON)</li>

        <title>Efficient XML Interchange (EXI)</title>
        <p>EXI is a very compact representation for the Extensible Markup Language (XML) Information Set that is intended to simultaneously optimize performance and the utilization of computational resources. The EXI format uses a hybrid approach drawn from the information and formal language theories, plus practical techniques verified by measurements, for entropy encoding XML information. Using a relatively simple algorithm, which is amenable to fast and compact implementation, and a small set of datatype representations, it reliably produces efficient encodings of XML event streams.</p>
