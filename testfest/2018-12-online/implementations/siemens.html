<h3>Siemens AG</h3>   
<p>
Siemens supports this specification as it allows manufacturers
to attach metadata to heterogeneous IoT devices and services in a uniform way.
The extensible model with a standardized serialization format in particular remedies interoperability challenges 
with an installed base of long-lived industrial devices.
Furthermore, 
this specification is a central building block for several digitalization topics such as 
device onboarding, 
device management, 
digital twins, 
and 
data analytics.
</p>
<p>
Siemens commits to several open-source implementations of W3C Web of Things, 
which are managed in the public Eclipse Thingweb project.
Siemens also implemented concepts of this specification in products and 
aims at aligning the implementations and opening the features to customers 
once this specification reaches REC status.

<h4 id="impl-siemens-node-wot">node-wot: TD Consumer and Producer</h4>
<p>
The node-wot implementation is a Node.js-based framework for WoT Servients.
It features an implementation of the WoT Scripting API to both consume TDs to instantiate Consumed Things 
and produce Exposed Things that provide a TD.
The node-wot implementation supports several Protocol Bindings including 
HTTP, CoAP, WebSockets, and MQTT,
with corresponding security mechanisms such as 
DTLS (CoAP); 
TLS (HTTP, MQTT),
Basic, Digest, and Bearer Token authentication (HTTP), 
PSK (CoAP), and 
username/password authentication (MQTT). 
</p>
<h4 id="impl-siemens-thingweb-directory">Thingweb Directory: TD Consumer and Producer</h4>
<p>
The Thingweb Directory provides a directory service written in Java to register TDs 
and look them up through queries (primarily SPARQL).
The implementation consumes TDs registered with it through a web API,
represent their metadata in a KnowledgeGraph, and (re-)produces TDs to return the results of queries.
Currently it supports HTTP and CoAP bindings.
</p>
<h4 id="impl-siemens-wot-fxui">WoT-fxUI: TD Consumer</h4>
<p>
WoT-fxUI is a generic user interface (UI) for Things based on Java with JavaFX.
It consumes TDs to render UI elements that allow human users to interact with Things.
The implementation currently supports HTTP and CoAP bindings.
