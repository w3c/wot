# Test Results
Place CSV assertion test results here, one subdirectory per organization, mirroring structure of TDs directory.
Further subdirectories may be used for multiple CSV files per implementation but these should be merged into
one result file at the top level using the `mergeresults.js` script in wot-thing-directory.
