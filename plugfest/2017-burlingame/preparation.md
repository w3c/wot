# Plugfest preparation for TPAC2017

# 1. Introduction

This document describes the information related to the next plugfest in Sunnyvale and demonstration in TPAC, Burlingame in November.

# 1.1 Backgroud

In the past plugfest, we've already checked consistency of the interfaces of two Servients provided by dirfferent menbers. They were combinations of application and device, or deivce to device. These application and devices were compatible to WoT anc talked with it.
To setup a larger scale system, the gateawy functions are required to connect multiple applications and devices located on the different places. Since some Servients may be connected to the local network and the others to the Internet, new issues for these connections should be considered such as security, firewall and NAT, device mangement and so on. This plugfest wiil be good opportunity to new issues to resoluve in the futre in WoT-WG.

# 1.2. Use case

The drawing below is an use case for the next plugfest. This is the smarthome application that the application on the smartphone can control the air conditioner in the house. The agent and the gateway have gateway functions that connects with appliations, devices, and gateways.

# 2. Servients

## 2.1 4-layered Servients

3 types of WoT Servients was derived from the use case described in 1.2. These are defined below:  
* Device Servient: WoT Servient with Exposed Thing, e.g. devices
* Application Servient: WoT Servient with Comsumed Thing, e.g. applications
* Proxy Servient: WoT Servient with both Exposed and Comsumed Thing, e.g. gateways

The Proxy Servient are seperated to 2 types fo them, Remote Proxy and Local Proxy. The Remote Proxy Servient is deployed on the Internet and connected with the Applicationd Serivent and the Local Proxy Servient. The Local Proxy Servient is done on the Local network and connects with the Remote Proxy Servient and the Device Servient. The layered diagram is shown below.

## 2.2 Servients from plugfest participants

The following figure shows diagrams of Servients that the participants provide for the plugest.
