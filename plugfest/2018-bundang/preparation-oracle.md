## 2.2 Checking points for the next plugfest

These were described in result.md in the Prague plugfest.

### (1) Connect with remote/local proxy

### (2) Application servients

### (3) Connect with node-wot

The Oracle IoT Cloud Service and the devices in the Digital Twin Simulator are accessible via a node-WoT instance
which includes an Oracle binding. 
This binding provides the integration between the IoT Cloud Service Product and the node-WoT reference implementation.

### (4) Scripting API

### (5) Thing Directory operation

### (6) Device Servients

### (7) Device simulators

#### Oracle Digital Twin Simulator
Oracle provides a Digital Twin Simulator for W3C WoT members, which is part of the Oracle IoT Cloud Service product.
This is a flexible simulation environment, which hosts multiple instances of various devices and a
simulation engine that allows the functional definition of a simulated device from a Web user interface.
It allows to build new device simulations with very small effort.

![Oracle_Simulator](images/Oracle-sim_overview.png)


These device simulations are exposed via node-WoT and behave just like regular node-WoT devices.

The simulator can serve for:
* visualizing a device from a TD in a Web UI
* testing interoperability with node-WoT based devices
* defining a new device and generating a TD
* generating device data based on a functional simulation model

![Oracle_Simulator](images/Oracle_sim_time_series.gif)

#### Simulated devices
Oracle provides "out of the box" device simulators for a variety of devices that are managed by the Digital Twin Simulator.
These are hosted in the Oracle IoT Cloud and are accessible via a node-WoT instance via an Oracle binding. 
The initial set of devices are a simulated Festo plant (Siemens), a Connected Car, HVAC, Blue Pump and several 
simulated devices that were built from the TDs from the Prague Plug Fest. 

##### Festo Simulator

##### Connected Car

##### HVAC

##### Fujitsu

![Oracle_Simulator](images/Oracle-sim_3_fujitsu_instances.png)

##### Panasonic

![Oracle_Simulator](images/Oracle-sim_panasonic.png)

#### Additional Device Simulations - TD import
Additional Device simulations can be easily defined by importing a device description in the 
Oracle Device Model format into the simulator.
The Device Model can be automatically generated from a Thing Description using the td2dm converter. 
This td2dm converter is provided in the "oracle-tools" folder.

#### Generating Thing Descriptions 
Alternatively, a device model for a new device can be easily created in the Oracle IoT Cloud Service using the management console.
This device model can be exported and the corresponding Thing Description can be automatically generated using the dm2td converter.
The dm2td converter is provided in the "oracle-tools" folder.

Oracle offers to assist other Plugfest participants to create simulated devices on demand.
If you are interested, please contact Michael.Lagally@oracle.com - preferably already before the plug fest.

# 5 Implementation guidelines

* "name" field of Thing Description shall be unique among the things which will be registered to Fujitsu Proxy.  
  Recommended convention is 'Company name'+'Thing name'  
  e.g.) "name": "PanasonicAirConditionerP1"
